Leptospirosis is a widespread and potentially fatal zoonosis that is endemic in 
many tropical regions and causes large epidemics after heavy rainfall and 
flooding. Infection results from direct or indirect exposure to infected 
reservoir host animals that carry the pathogen in their renal tubules and shed 
pathogenic leptospires in their urine. Although many wild and domestic animals 
can serve as reservoir hosts, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) is the most 
important source of human infections. Individuals living in urban slum 
environments characterized by inadequate sanitation and poor housing are at high 
risk of rat exposure and leptospirosis. The global burden of leptospirosis is 
expected to rise with demographic shifts that favor increases in the number of 
urban poor in tropical regions subject to worsening storms and urban flooding 
due to climate change. Data emerging from prospective surveillance studies 
suggest that most human leptospiral infections in endemic areas are mild or 
asymptomatic. Development of more severe outcomes likely depends on three 
factors: epidemiological conditions, host susceptibility, and pathogen virulence 
(Fig. 1). Mortality increases with age, particularly in patients older than 60 
years of age. High levels of bacteremia are associated with poor clinical 
outcomes and, based on animal model and in vitro studies, are related in part to 
poor recognition of leptospiral LPS by human TLR4. Patients with severe 
leptospirosis experience a cytokine storm characterized by high levels of IL-6, 
TNF-alpha, and IL-10. Patients with the HLA DQ6 allele are at higher risk of 
disease, suggesting a role for lymphocyte stimulation by a leptospiral 
superantigen. Leptospirosis typically presents as a nonspecific, acute febrile 
illness characterized by fever, myalgia, and headache and may be confused with 
other entities such as influenza and dengue fever. Newer diagnostic methods 
facilitate early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment. Patients progressing to 
multisystem organ failure have widespread hematogenous dissemination of 
pathogens. Nonoliguric (high output) renal dysfunction should be supported with 
fluids and electrolytes. When oliguric renal failure occurs, prompt initiation 
of dialysis can be life saving. Elevated bilirubin levels are due to 
hepatocellular damage and disruption of intercellular junctions between 
hepatocytes, resulting in leaking of bilirubin out of bile caniliculi. 
Hemorrhagic complications are common and are associated with coagulation 
abnormalities. Severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome due to extensive alveolar 
hemorrhage has a fatality rate of >50 %. Readers are referred to earlier,

Climate change has already impacted the transmission of a wide range of 
vector-borne diseases in Europe, and it will continue to do so in the coming 
decades. Climate change has been implicated in the observed shift of ticks to 
elevated altitudes and latitudes, notably including the Ixodes ricinus tick 
species that is a vector for Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. 
Climate change is also thought to have been a factor in the expansion of other 
important disease vectors in Europe: Aedes albopictus (the Asian tiger 
mosquito), which transmits diseases such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya, and 
Phlebotomus sandfly species, which transmits diseases including Leishmaniasis. 
In addition, highly elevated temperatures in the summer of 2010 have been 
associated with an epidemic of West Nile Fever in Southeast Europe and 
subsequent outbreaks have been linked to summer temperature anomalies. Future 
climate-sensitive health impacts are challenging to project quantitatively, in 
part due to the intricate interplay between non-climatic and climatic drivers, 
weather-sensitive pathogens and climate-change adaptation. Moreover, 
globalisation and international air travel contribute to pathogen and vector 
dispersion internationally. Nevertheless, monitoring forecasts of meteorological 
conditions can help detect epidemic precursors of vector-borne disease outbreaks 
and serve as early warning systems for risk reduction.

Climate change is known to affect Pacific Island nations in a variety of ways. 
One of them is by increasing the vulnerability of human health induced by 
various climate change impacts, which pose an additional burden to the already 
distressed health systems in the region. This paper explores the associations 
between climate change and human health on the one hand, and outlines some of 
the health care challenges posed by a changing climate on the other. In 
particular, it describes the links between climate variations and the emergence 
of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, such as the mosquito-borne diseases 
dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The paper also presents a summary of the key 
findings of the research initiatives Climate Change and Prevalence Study of ZIKA 
Virus Diseases in Fiji and the findings from the World Mosquito Program as two 
examples of public health action in the Pacific region.

Arboviruses are a diverse group of vector-borne viruses, many of whose members 
are the cause of significant human morbidity and mortality. Over the last 
30 years, the emergence and/or resurgence of arboviruses have posed a 
considerable global health threat. The ongoing geographical expansion of the 
dengue viruses (DENV), along with the explosive outbreaks of West Nile virus 
(WNV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and more recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) have all 
served as reminders that new epidemics may emerge at any time from this 
diversity. A clearer understanding of what mechanisms drive these dramatic 
changes in vector-host transmission cycles that result in the human population 
becoming significantly more exposed, will help to prepare us for the next 
emerging epidemic/pandemic. This Chapter seeks to provide a brief overview of 
the arboviruses, their mode of transmission and some of the known factors that 
drive their expansion.

Global climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is 
being particularly felt in Canada, with warming generally greater than in the 
rest of the world. Continued warming will be accompanied by changes in 
precipitation, which will vary across the country and seasons, and by increasing 
climate variability and extreme weather events. Climate change will likely drive 
the emergence of infectious diseases in Canada by northward spread from the 
United States and introduction from elsewhere in the world via air and sea 
transport. Diseases endemic to Canada are also likely to re-emerge. This special 
issue describes key infectious disease risks associated with climate change. 
These include emergence of tick-borne diseases in addition to Lyme disease, the 
possible introduction of exotic mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and 
dengue, more epidemics of Canada-endemic vector-borne diseases such as West Nile 
virus, and increased incidence of foodborne illnesses. Risk is likely to be 
compounded by an aging population affected by chronic diseases, which results in 
greater sensitivity to infectious diseases. Identifying emerging disease risks 
is essential to assess our vulnerability, and a starting point to identify where 
public health effort is required to reduce the vulnerability and exposure of the 
Canadian population.

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has spread throughout the 
tropical world over the past 60 years and now affects over half the world's 
population. The geographical range of dengue is expected to further expand due 
to ongoing global phenomena including climate change and urbanization. We 
applied statistical mapping techniques to the most extensive database of case 
locations to date to predict global environmental suitability for the virus as 
of 2015. We then made use of climate, population and socioeconomic projections 
for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080 to project future changes in virus suitability 
and human population at risk. This study is the first to consider the spread of 
Aedes mosquito vectors to project dengue suitability. Our projections provide a 
key missing piece of evidence for the changing global threat of vector-borne 
disease and will help decision-makers worldwide to better prepare for and 
respond to future changes in dengue risk.

BACKGROUND: The climate variables that directly influence vector-borne diseases' 
ecosystems are mainly temperature and rainfall. This is not only because the 
vectors bionomics are strongly dependent upon these variables, but also because 
most of the elements of the systems are impacted, such as the host behavior and 
development and the pathogen amplification. The impact of the climate changes on 
the transmission patterns of these diseases is not easily understood, since many 
confounding factors are acting together. Consequently, knowledge of these 
impacts is often based on hypothesis derived from mathematical models. 
Nevertheless, some direct evidences can be found for several vector-borne 
diseases.
MAIN BODY: Evidences of the impact of climate change are available for malaria, 
arbovirus diseases such as dengue, and many other parasitic and viral diseases 
such as Rift Valley Fever, Japanese encephalitis, human African trypanosomiasis 
and leishmaniasis. The effect of temperature and rainfall change as well as 
extreme events, were found to be the main cause for outbreaks and are alarming 
the global community. Among the main driving factors, climate strongly 
influences the geographical distribution of insect vectors, which is rapidly 
changing due to climate change. Further, in both models and direct evidences, 
climate change is seen to be affecting vector-borne diseases more strikingly in 
fringe of different climatic areas often in the border of transmission zones, 
which were once free of these diseases with human populations less immune and 
more receptive. The impact of climate change is also more devastating because of 
the unpreparedness of Public Health systems to provide adequate response to the 
events, even when climatic warning is available. Although evidences are strong 
at the regional and local levels, the studies on impact of climate change on 
vector-borne diseases and health are producing contradictory results at the 
global level.
CONCLUSIONS: In this paper we discuss the current state of the results and draw 
on evidences from malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases to illustrate 
the state of current thinking and outline the need for further research to 
inform our predictions and response.

Climate is one of several causes of disease emergence. Although half or more of 
infectious diseases are affected by climate it appears to be a relatively 
infrequent cause of human disease emergence. Climate mostly affects diseases 
caused by pathogens that spend part of their lifecycle outside of the host, 
exposed to the environment. The most important routes of transmission of climate 
sensitive diseases are by arthropod (insect and tick) vectors, in water and in 
food. Given the sensitivity of many diseases to climate, it is very likely that 
at least some will respond to future climate change. In the case of vector-borne 
diseases this response will include spread to new areas. Several vector-borne 
diseases have emerged in Europe in recent years; these include vivax malaria, 
West Nile fever, dengue fever, Chikungunya fever, leishmaniasis, Lyme disease 
and tick-borne encephalitis. The vectors of these diseases are mosquitoes, sand 
flies and ticks. The UK has endemic mosquito species capable of transmitting 
malaria and probably other pathogens, and ticks that transmit Lyme disease. The 
UK is also threatened by invasive mosquito species known to be able to transmit 
West Nile, dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and sand flies that spread 
leishmaniasis. Warmer temperatures in the future will increase the suitability 
of the UK's climate for these invasive species, and increase the risk that they 
may spread disease. While much attention is on invasive species, it is important 
to recognize the threat presented by native species too. Proposed actions to 
reduce the future impact of emerging vector-borne diseases in the UK include 
insect control activity at points of entry of vehicles and certain goods, wider 
surveillance for mosquitoes and sand flies, research into the threat posed by 
native species, increased awareness of the medical profession of the threat 
posed by specific diseases, regular risk assessments, and increased preparedness 
for the occurrence of a disease emergency.

Forecasting the impacts of climate change on Aedes-borne viruses-especially 
dengue, chikungunya, and Zika-is a key component of public health preparedness. 
We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors 
Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict 
cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare 
them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models 
(GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature 
ranges for transmission (21.3-34.0°C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9-29.4°C for Ae. 
albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. 
However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different 
patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios 
produce larger population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by 
Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of transmission 
from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for 
most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are 
expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. 
Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new 
exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As 
major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. 
albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. 
Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) 
exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to 
increased net and new exposures to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme 
increases in Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate 
climate change scenarios.

BACKGROUND: Vibrio cholerae, a Gram-negative, non-spore forming curved rod is 
found in diverse aquatic ecosystems around the planet. It is classified 
according to its major surface antigen into around 206 serogroups, of which O1 
and O139 cause epidemic cholera. A recent spatial modelling technique estimated 
that around 2.86 million cholera cases occur globally every year, and of them 
approximately 95,000 die. About 1.3 billion people are currently at risk of 
infection from cholera. Meta-analysis and mathematical modelling have 
demonstrated that due to global warming the burden of vector-borne diseases like 
malaria, leishmaniasis, meningococcal meningitis, viral encephalitis, dengue and 
chikungunya will increase in the coming years in the tropics and beyond.
CHOLERA AND CLIMATE: This review offers an overview of the interplay between 
global warming and the pathogenicity and epidemiology of V. cholerae. Several 
distinctive features of cholera survival (optimal thriving at 15% salinity, 
30 °C water temperature, and pH 8.5) indicate a possible role of climate change 
in triggering the epidemic process. Genetic exchange (ctxAB, zot, ace, cep, and 
orfU) between strains and transduction process allows potential emergence of new 
toxigenic clones. These processes are probably controlled by precise 
environmental signals such as optimum temperature, sunlight and osmotic 
conditions. Environmental influences on phytoplankton growth and chitin 
remineralization will be discussed alongside the interplay of poor sanitary 
conditions, overcrowding, improper sewage disposal and global warming in 
promoting the growth and transmission of this deadly disease.
CONCLUSION: The development of an effective early warning system based on 
climate data could help to prevent and control future outbreaks. It may become 
possible to integrate real-time monitoring of oceanic regions, climate 
variability and epidemiological and demographic population dynamics to predict 
cholera outbreaks and support the design of cost-effective public health 
strategies.
