"ESMN8L6X","book","2011","McLaughlin, Brett","What Is HTML5?","","978-1-4493-1449-1","","","","HTML5: Everyone’s using it, nobody knows what it is. I realize that sounds more like a line out of an existential movie — maybe Waiting for Godot or a screenplay by Sartre — than a statement about HTML5. But it’s really the truth: most of the people using HTML5 are treating it as HTML4+, or even worse, HTML4 (and some stuff they don’t use). The result? A real delay in the paradigm shift that HTML5 is almost certain to bring. It’s certainly not time to look away, because by the time you look back, you may have missed something really important: a subtle but important transition centered around HTML5.","2011-07-13","2016-09-30 20:27:08","2016-10-03 02:48:35","","","29","","","","","","","","","","""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""","","en","","","","","Google Books","","00005  Google-Books-ID: mGx1MyjwM8AC","","","https://play.google.com/books?id=mGx1MyjwM8AC","","Computers / Programming Languages / HTML","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We searched: Cochrane library (2002; Issue 3), medline (1977–2002/5), embase (1980–2002/7); cinahl (1982–2002/5); assia (1982–2002/7), bni (1994–2002/5), eric (1985–2002/6); lisa (1969—current), NRR (2002, Issue 2), the world-wide-web and references. The selection criteria consisted of randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after, and controlled cohort studies in comparison with no training. The intervention had to be one to eight hours training in literature search and retrieval skills for health professionals. The outcome was the effect on health professionals’ literature search and retrieval skill levels measured through reliable instruments. For data collection and ana-lysis, one reviewer extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies and the second reviewer checked it. The results indicate that there is some evidence of positive impact on health professionals’ skill levels in literature searching and they find the training useful. In conclusion, the size of the positive effect is debatable as only three small and methodologically weak studies met the inclusion criteria and out of those only two showed the positive effect.","2003-03-01","2016-09-27 09:00:06","2016-09-27 09:00:06","2016-09-27 09:00:06","33-41","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\KA22836F\abstract.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

B.","Data fabrication and other reasons for non-random sampling in 5087 randomised, controlled trials in anaesthetic and general medical journals","Anaesthesia","","1365-2044","10.1111/anae.13938","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anae.13938","Randomised, controlled trials have been retracted after publication because of data fabrication and inadequate ethical approval. Fabricated data have included baseline variables, for instance, age, height or weight. Statistical tests can determine the probability of the distribution of means, given their standard deviation and the number of participants in each group. Randomised, controlled trials have been retracted after the data distributions have been calculated as improbable. Most retracted trials have been written by anaesthetists and published by specialist anaesthetic journals. I wanted to explore whether the distribution of baseline data in trials was consistent with the expected distribution. I wanted to determine whether trials retracted after publication had distributions different to trials that have not been retracted. I wanted to determine whether data distributions in trials published in specialist anaesthetic journals have been different to distributions in non-specialist medical journals. I analysed the distribution of 72,261 means of 29,789 variables in 5087 randomised, controlled trials published in eight journals between January 2000 and December 2015: Anaesthesia (399); Anesthesia and Analgesia (1288); Anesthesiology (541); British Journal of Anaesthesia (618); Canadian Journal of Anesthesia (384); European Journal of Anaesthesiology (404); Journal of the American Medical Association (518) and New England Journal of Medicine (935). I chose these journals as I had electronic access to the full text. Trial p values were distorted by an excess of baseline means that were similar and an excess that were dissimilar: 763/5015 (15.2%) trials that had not been retracted from publication had p values that were within 0.05 of 0 or 1 (expected 10%), that is, a 5.2% excess, p = 1.2 × 10−7. The p values of 31/72 (43%) trials that had been retracted after publication were within 0.05 of 0 or 1, a rate different to that for unretracted trials, p = 1.03 × 10−10. The difference between the distributions of these two subgroups was confirmed by comparison of their overall distributions, p = 5.3 × 10−15. Each journal exhibited the same abnormal distribution of baseline means. There was no difference in distributions of baseline means for 1453 trials in non-anaesthetic journals and 3634 trials in anaesthetic journals, p = 0.30. The rate of retractions from JAMA and NEJM, 6/1453 or 1 in 242, was one-quarter the rate from the six anaesthetic journals, 66/3634 or 1 in 55, relative risk (99%CI) 0.23 (0.08–0.68), p = 0.00022. A probability threshold of 1 in 10,000 identified 8/72 (11%) retracted trials (7 by Fujii et al.) and 82/5015 (1.6%) unretracted trials. Some p values were so extreme that the baseline data could not be correct: for instance, for 43/5015 unretracted trials the probability was less than 1 in 1015 (equivalent to one drop of water in 20,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools). A probability threshold of 1 in 100 for two or more trials by the same author identified three authors of retracted trials (Boldt, Fujii and Reuben) and 21 first or corresponding authors of 65 unretracted trials. Fraud, unintentional error, correlation, stratified allocation and poor methodology might have contributed to the excess of randomised, controlled trials with similar or dissimilar means, a pattern that was common to all the surveyed journals. It is likely that this work will lead to the identification, correction and retraction of hitherto unretracted randomised, controlled trials.","","2018-06-15 00:02:54","2018-06-15 00:02:54","2018-06-15 00:02:54","944-952","","8","72","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/arindambose/Zotero/zotero_stored_pdfs/Anaesthesia/undefined/Carlisle_Data fabrication and other reasons for non-random sampling in 5087 randomised,.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\4VW8XC9E\anae.html","","","controlled trials; data error; fraud; randomised","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this research it to explore the design space of possible visualization–text linking and interactions based on various triggers such as mouse events. We describe a framework that takes text containing markup, a related dataset, and a conﬁguration ﬁle as inputs and produces an interactive document. The resulting document provides interactions such as details on demand, visual highlighting and comparison, and bushing-and-linking.

The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual-level genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique—cross-trait LD Score regression—for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use this method to estimate 276 genetic correlations among 24 traits. The results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity, and educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of genome-wide analyses, as there currently are no significantly associated SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment.","2015-11","2018-06-04 06:01:44","2018-06-04 06:01:44","2018-06-04 06:01:44","1236-1241","","11","47","","","","","","","","","","en","2015 Nature Publishing Group","","","","www.nature.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\AYGMRV69\ng.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We examined the role of urate genes on the risk of diuretic-induced incident gout in 6850 women from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and in 4223 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). Two published genetic risk scores (GRSs) were calculated using urate-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms for 8 (GRS8) and 29 genes (GRS29). Results Our analyses included 727 and 354 confirmed incident gout cases in HPFS and NHS, respectively. The multivariate relative risk (RR) for diuretic use was 2.20 and 1.69 among those with GRS8 < and ≥ the median (p for interaction=0.27). The corresponding RRs using GRS29 were 2.19 and 1.88 (p for interaction=0.40). The lack of interaction persisted in NHS (all p values >0.20) and in our analyses limited to those with hypertension in both cohorts. SLC22A11 (OAT4) showed a significant interaction only among women but in the opposite direction to the recent study.

Excess adiposity is a major risk factor for diabetes, and thus maintaining a healthy body weight and avoidance of excess weight gain during adulthood is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention. Independent of body weight, the quality or type of dietary fat and carbohydrates is more crucial than the quantity in determining diabetes risk. Higher consumption of coffee, whole grains, fruits, and nuts is associated with lower risk of diabetes, whereas regular consumption of refined grains, red and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages including fruits juices is associated with increased risk. Dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts and legumes, but lower in red and processed meats, refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages are consistently associated with reduced diabetes risk, even after adjustment for body mass index. The genome-wide association studies conducted in these cohorts have contributed substantially to the discoveries of novel genetic loci for type 2 diabetes and other metabolic traits, although the identified common variants explain only a small proportion of overall diabetes predisposition. Taken together, these ongoing large cohort studies have provided convincing epidemiologic evidence that a healthy diet, together with regular physical activity, maintenance of a healthy weight, moderate alcohol consumption, and avoidance of prolonged sedentary behaviors and smoking would prevent the majority of type 2 diabetes cases.","2014-12-01","2018-06-04 05:58:48","2018-06-04 05:58:48","2018-06-04 05:58:48","345-354","","4","3","","Curr Nutr Rep","Diet, Lifestyle, and Genetic Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LEWNVM7B\s13668-014-0103-5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GWAS of obesity-related phenotypes have been especially successful. To translate this success into a research tool, we developed and tested a “genetic risk score” (GRS) that summarizes an individual’s genetic predisposition to obesity. Methods Different GWAS of obesity-related phenotypes report different sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as the best genomic markers of obesity risk. Therefore, we applied a 3-stage approach that pooled results from multiple GWAS to select SNPs to include in our GRS: The 3 stages are (1) Extraction. SNPs with evidence of association are compiled from published GWAS; (2) Clustering. SNPs are grouped according to patterns of linkage disequilibrium; (3) Selection. Tag SNPs are selected from clusters that meet specific criteria. We applied this 3-stage approach to results from 16 GWAS of obesity-related phenotypes in European-descent samples to create a GRS. We then tested the GRS in the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities (ARIC) Study cohort (N=10,745, 55% female, 77% white, 23% African American). Results Our 32-locus GRS was a statistically significant predictor of body mass index (BMI) and obesity among ARIC whites (for BMI, r=0.13, p<1×10−30; for obesity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.57 [95% CI 0.55–0.58]). The GRS improved prediction of obesity (as measured by delta-AUC and integrated discrimination index) when added to models that included demographic and geographic information. FTO- and MC4R-linked SNPs, and a non-genetic risk assessment consisting of a socioeconomic index (p<0.01 for all comparisons). The GRS also predicted increased mortality risk over 17 years of follow-up. The GRS performed less well among African Americans. Conclusions The obesity GRS derived using our 3-stage approach is not useful for clinical risk prediction, but may have value as a tool for etiological and treatment research.","2013","2018-06-04 05:56:58","2018-06-04 05:56:58","2018-06-04 05:56:58","","","1","59","","Biodemography Soc Biol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23701538 PMCID: PMC3671353","","/Users/arindambose/Zotero/zotero_stored_pdfs/Biodemography and social biology/2013/Belsky et al_2013_Development and Evaluation of a Genetic Risk Score for Obesity.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671353/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Genetic risk scores that use information from genome-wide meta-analyses can successfully predict cardiovascular outcomes and subclinical phenotypes, yet there is limited clinical utility of these scores beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors in many populations. Novel uses of genetic risk scores include evaluating the genetic contribution of specific intermediate traits or risk factors to cardiovascular disease, risk prediction in high-risk populations, gene-by-environment interaction studies, and Mendelian randomization studies.

This study evaluated whether genetic markers previously identified in whites are associated with nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (MI) in Hispanics. METHODS AND RESULTS Cases (n=1989) with a first nonfatal acute MI and population-based controls (n=2096) living in Costa Rica were studied. Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 3 independent loci showed significant associations with MI. The odds ratios for the loci with the strongest associations were 1.16 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.27) for rs4977574 (CDKN2A/2B), 1.15 (95 CI, 1.03 to 1.29) for rs646776 (CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1), and 1.22 (95 CI, 1.08 to 1.38) for rs501120 (CXCL12); the corresponding PARs were 6.8, 10.5, and 15.2; respectively. We developed a genetic risk score by summing the number of the top 3 associated risk alleles. The OR for MI per genetic risk score unit was 1.18 (95 CI, 1.11 to 1.25; P=4.83 × 10(-8)). Discrimination of MI was significantly improved (P=0.02) when the genetic risk score was added to a model including clinical predictors. However, the increase in the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve after the genetic risk score was added was moderate, from 0.67 (95 CI, 0.65 to 0.69) to 0.68 (95 CI, 0.66 to 0.70). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate both the consistency and disparity of genetic effects on risk of MI between Hispanic and white populations. The improvement in the identified genetic markers on discrimination of MI in Hispanics was modest.","","2018-06-03 06:54:45","2018-06-03 06:54:45","2018-06-03 06:54:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/arindambose/Zotero/zotero_stored_pdfs/undefined/undefined/Genetic risk score and risk of myocardial infarction in Hispanics.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\F9Q4BMM9\32a467783c14c34b859f9508e718f9f142a5f273.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimate the total yearly volume of peer-reviewed scientific journal articles published world-wide as well as the share of these articles available openly on the Web either directly or as copies in e-print repositories. Method. We rely on data from two commercial databases (ISI and Ulrich's) supplemented by sampling and Google searches. Analysis. A central issue is the finding that ISI-indexed journals publish far more articles per year (111) than non ISI-indexed journals (26), which means that the total figure we obtain is much lower than many earlier estimates. Our method of analysing the number of repository copies (green open access) differs from several earlier studies which have studied the number of copies in identified repositories, since we start from a random sample of articles and then test if copies can be found via a Web search engine. Results. We estimate that in 2006 the total number of articles published was approximately 1 350 000. Of this number 4.6 % became immediately openly available and an additional 3.5 % after an embargo period of typically one year. Furthermore usable copies of 11.3 % could be found in subject-specific or institutional repositories or on the home pages of the authors. Conclusions. We believe our results are the most reliable so far published, and should thus be useful in the on-going debate about Open Access among both academics and science policy makers. The method is replicable and also lends itself to longitudinal studies in the future.","","2016-10-16 06:07:01","2016-10-17 23:30:59","","","","","","","","Scientific journal publishing","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/","text","","","","","00166","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\P68B6SF3\paper391.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cobenefits may be possible from more upstream mitigation of greenhouse gases causing climate change. To help measure such cobenefits alongside averted disease-specific risks, a health impact assessment (HIA) framework can more comprehensively serve as a decision support tool. HIA also considers health equity, clearly part of the climate change problem. New choices for energy must be made carefully considering such effects as additional pressure on the world's forests through large-scale expansion of soybean and oil palm plantations, leading to forest clearing, biodiversity loss and disease emergence, expulsion of subsistence farmers, and potential increases in food prices and emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

A Historical Perspective on the Place of Methods During the Classical (1945–1965) Phase of Epidemiology","Annual Review of Public Health","","","10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031914-122403","http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031914-122403","Before World War II, epidemiology was a small discipline, practiced by a handful of people working mostly in the United Kingdom and in the United States. Today it is practiced by tens of thousands of people on all continents. Between 1945 and 1965, during what is known as its “classical” phase, epidemiology became recognized as a major academic discipline in medicine and public health. On the basis of a review of the historical evidence, this article examines to which extent classical epidemiology has been a golden age of an action-driven, problem-solving science, in which epidemiologists were less concerned with the sophistication of their methods than with the societal consequences of their work. It also discusses whether the paucity of methods stymied or boosted classical epidemiology's ability to convince political and financial agencies about the need to intervene in order to improve the health of the people.","2015","2016-10-14 22:48:21","2016-10-17 23:30:41","2016-10-14 22:48:21","69-88","","1","36","","","Has Epidemiology Become Infatuated With Methods?","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","00002  PMID: 25594331","","","","","bias; causal inference; confounding; effect measures; history; interaction; occurrence measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is most common in young children, with a bimodal peak at 2 and 5 years of age. Eighty percent of children will have had a least one episode of OME by the age of 10 years. At age 7–8 years, about 8% of children will have middle ear effusions; this incidence increases in winter. The mean duration of effusions is 6–10 weeks but some cases are more persistent. OME is known to be a fluctuating condition with symptoms that vary with time and with age. The main symptom of OME is impaired hearing because the middle ear effusion causes a conductive hearing loss by reflection of the sound energy at the air–fluid interface. The diagnosis is based on suspicion of hearing loss, clinical history, clinical examination of the ears and appropriate audiometry and tympanometry. While most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, some children will need intervention because of the effects of hearing loss. This intervention may take the form of educational and social action or the provision of a hearing aid to minimise the impact of the hearing loss. No non-surgical intervention has yet been shown conclusively to be of benefit. Surgical management usually takes the form of myringotomy and insertion of a ventilation tube (grommet), with or without adenoidectomy. Children with cleft palate are particularly susceptible to OME because of the impaired function of the Eustachian tube that results from the palatal anomaly, which in turn leads to a failure of middle ear ventilation. Similarly, children with Down’s syndrome have a high incidence of OME, partly because of their impaired immunity and mucosal abnormality, with resulting susceptibility to ear infection. These groups of children need particular surveillance for OME so that proper action can be taken. This guideline attempts to bring together the evidence related to surgical management of OME in children younger than 12 years, and to advise on best and safest practice; treatment decisions need to balance potential benefits against potential risks, reflecting the fact that the degree of benefit usually depends upon the severity and persistence of the condition.","2008","2016-10-03 10:17:14","2016-10-09 20:52:51","2016-10-03 10:17:14","","","","","","","","National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: Guidance","","","","RCOG Press","London","eng","Copyright © 2008, National Collaborating Centre for Women’s and Children’s Health.","","","","PubMed","NBK51742","00000  PMID: 21452461","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21452461","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was originally developed for Phred base calling to help in the automation of DNA sequencing in the Human Genome Project. Phred quality scores are assigned to each nucleotide base call in automated sequencer traces. The FASTQ format encodes phred scores as ASCII characters alongside the read sequences. Phred quality scores have become widely accepted to characterize the quality of DNA sequences, and can be used to compare the efficacy of different sequencing methods. Perhaps the most important use of Phred quality scores is the automatic determination of accurate, quality-based consensus sequences.","2019-02-27","2019-10-10 01:41:54","2019-10-10 01:41:54","2019-10-10 01:41:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 885275603","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\7KAJ28TV\2019 - Phred quality score.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[et al.","","978-0-470-05724-7","","","","This book provides a clear and thorough introduction to meta-analysis, the process of synthesizing data from a series of separate studies. Meta-analysis has become a critically important tool in fields as diverse as medicine, pharmacology, epidemiology, education, psychology, business, and ecology. This book outlines the role of meta-analysis in the research process. It shows how to compute effects sizes and treatment effects. It explains the fixed-effect and random-effects models for synthesizing data. It demonstrates how to assess and interpret variation in effect size across studies. It explains how to avoid common mistakes in meta-analysis. It discusses controversies in meta-analysis. It includes sections on additional readings and other resources. The book's approach is primarily conceptual, but with sufficient detail so that readers can implement the procedures in their own research. Key ideas are introduced using text and figures, followed by the relevant formulas and worked examples. These examples, as well as additional exercises and materials, may be downloaded from the book's web site. The authors have extensive experience in the theory and application of meta-analysis. As a group, they have hundreds of publications in this area, as well as many years of experience teaching meta-analysis to researchers, clinicians and statisticians. This book builds on this foundation and will serve equally well as the text for a course in meta-analysis, as a resource for self-study, or as a reference. 'The approach taken by ""Introduction to Meta-analysis"" is intended to be primarily conceptual, and it is amazingly successful at achieving that goal. The reader can comfortably skip the formulas and still understand their application and underlying motivation. For the more statistically sophisticated reader, the relevant formulas, and worked examples provide a superb practical guide to performing a meta-analysis' - Jesse A. Berlin, ScD.

Among a range of applications, PRS are exploited to assess shared aetiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the predictive power of genetic data for use in clinical settings, and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed on individuals, or their biological samples (eg. tissues, cells), at the tails of the PRS distribution and contrasted. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are set to play a key role in personalised medicine. However, despite the growing application and importance of PRS, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice. We also discuss different methods for the calculation of PRS, common misconceptions regarding the interpretation of results and future challenges.","2018-09-14","2019-09-11 09:34:29","2019-09-11 09:34:29","2019-09-11 09:34:29","","","","","","","","","","","","Genomics","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/416545","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\9RFMXMFU\Choi et al. - 2018 - A guide to performing Polygenic Risk Score analyse.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aims To test whether the effect of polygenic risk scores on MDD is moderated by childhood trauma. Method The study sample consisted of 1645 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD and 340 screened controls from The Netherlands. Chronic or remitted episodes (severe MDD) were present in 956 participants. The occurrence of childhood trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Interview and the polygenic risk scores were based on genome-wide meta-analysis results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Results The polygenic risk scores and childhood trauma independently affected MDD risk, and evidence was found for interaction as departure from both multiplicativity and additivity, indicating that the effect of polygenic risk scores on depression is increased in the presence of childhood trauma. The interaction effects were similar in predicting all MDD risk and severe MDD risk, and explained a proportion of variation in MDD risk comparable to the polygenic risk scores themselves. Conclusions The interaction effect found between polygenic risk scores and childhood trauma implies that (1) studies on direct genetic effect on MDD gain power by focusing on individuals exposed to childhood trauma, and that (2) individuals with both high polygenic risk scores and exposure to childhood trauma are particularly at risk for developing MDD.","2014-08","2019-05-11 05:27:18","2019-09-11 07:03:56","2019-05-11 05:27:18","113-119","","2","205","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge Core","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\EWNER8P5\Peyrot et al. - 2014 - Effect of polygenic risk scores on depression in c.pdf; false; /Users/arindambose/Downloads/zotero_downloads/The British Journal of Psychiatry/2014/peyrot_etal_2014_effect_of.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\SLMUJF7I\9B0B42D042DDABD0FFF32E11A5C481D0.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Screening is the testing of apparently well people to find those at increased risk of having a disease or disorder. Although an earlier diagnosis generally has intuitive appeal, earlier might not always be better, or worth the cost. Four terms describe the validity of a screening test: sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of positive and negative results. For tests with continuous variables-eg, blood glucose-sensitivity and specificity are inversely related; where the cutoff for abnormal is placed should indicate the clinical effect of wrong results. The prevalence of disease in a population affects screening test performance: in low-prevalence settings, even very good tests have poor predictive value positives. Hence, knowledge of the approximate prevalence of disease is a prerequisite to interpreting screening test results. Tests are often done in sequence, as is true for syphilis and HIV-1 infection. Lead-time and length biases distort the apparent value of screening programmes; randomised controlled trials are the only way to avoid these biases. Screening can improve health; strong indirect evidence links cervical cytology programmes to declines in cervical cancer mortality. However, inappropriate application or interpretation of screening tests can rob people of their perceived health, initiate harmful diagnostic testing, and squander health-care resources.","2002-03-09","2019-05-19 07:40:37","2019-05-19 07:40:37","2019-05-19 07:40:37","881-884","","9309","359","","The Lancet","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\QYHXJ2TS\S0140673602079485.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was investigated in relation to four questions:- is agreement greater for some domains (e.g. physical HRQoL) than others?; do parents perceive illness to have a greater impact than their child?; how is agreement affected by child age, gender and illness status?; and is the relationship between proxy ratings affected by the method of data collection? Fourteen studies were identified. Consistent with previous research, there was greater agreement for observable functioning (e.g. physical HRQoL), and less for non-observable functioning (e.g. emotional or social HRQoL). Three studies assessed whether parents perceive the illness to have a greater impact than their child, but no clear conclusions could be drawn given differences in measures used. Agreement is better between parents and chronically sick children compared with parents and their healthy children, but no effects were found for age or gender. All of these results may be dependent on the specific measure of HRQoL employed. There remain strong arguments for obtaining information from both parents and children whenever possible.","2001-05-01","2019-05-19 05:16:17","2019-05-19 05:16:17","2019-05-19 05:16:17","347-357","","4","10","","Qual Life Res","Can parents rate their child's health-related quality of life?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Children; Chronic illness; Proxy raters; Quality of life measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a Parsons problem the correct code is provided, but is broken into mixed-up code blocks that must be assembled in the correct order. Two-dimensional Parsons problems also require the code blocks to be indented correctly. Parsons problems can contain extra code blocks, called distractors, which are not needed in a correct solution. We present a study that compared the efficiency, effectiveness, and cognitive load of learning from solving two-dimensional Parsons problems with distractors, versus fixing code with the same errors as the distractors, versus writing the equivalent code. We found that solving two-dimensional Parsons problems with distractors took significantly less time than fixing code with errors or than writing the equivalent code.

Evidence based family oriented support for young carers and their families in Germany is currently being developed. To allow for scientific evaluation, an outcome criterion needs to be chosen. Until today, there are no assessment instruments available, which focus on young carer's specific demands and needs. As HRQOL seems to be an adequate alternative outcome criterion, an integrative review of the literature was carried out to verify this assumption. Methods: The aim of the integrative review was to get information about a) the concept and the common definition of HRQOL in children, b) preferable HRQOL assessment techniques in children, and c) the relevance of HRQOL measures for the population of young carers. An additional aim of the review was to give advice on which instrument fits best to assess young carer's HRQOL in Germany. Searches were conducted in PubMed in order to obtain papers reporting about a) the development or psychometric assessment of instruments measuring HRQOL in children and adolescents up to the age of 18, and b) on the conceptual framework of HRQOL in children. Results: HRQOL is a multidimensional construct covering physical, emotional, mental, social, and behavioural components of well-being and functioning as subjective perceived by a person depending on the cultural context and value system one is living in. Young carer's problems and needs are well covered by these common domains of HRQOL. Since no specific HRQOL-measures are available to address young carers, a generic one has to be chosen which a) has been created for use in children, b) allows self- and proxy-report, and c) has good psychometric testing results. Comparing four generic measures with currently best published psychometric testing results, items of the KIDSCREEN cover young carer's specific problems most accurate. Conclusion: The KIDSCREEN questionnaires seems adequate to evaluate the intervention as their items cover young carer's needs and problems most accurate.","2008-12","2019-05-14 06:50:46","2019-05-14 06:50:47","2019-05-14 06:50:46","","","1","8","","","The use of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents as an outcome criterion to evaluate family oriented support for young carers in Germany","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\A5YGWV6N\Schlarmann et al. - 2008 - The use of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How can we determine the big ideas worth understanding? Why is understanding an important teaching goal, and how do we know when students have attained it? How can we create a rigorous and engaging curriculum that focuses on understanding and leads to improved student performance in today s high-stakes, standards-based environment? Authors Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe answer these and many other questions in this second edition of Understanding by Design. Drawing on feedback from thousands of educators around the world who have used the UbD framework since its introduction in 1998, the authors have greatly revised and expanded their original work to guide educators across the K 16 spectrum in the design of curriculum, assessment, and instruction. With an improved UbD Template at its core, the book explains the rationale of backward design and explores in greater depth the meaning of such key ideas as essential questions and transfer tasks. Readers will learn why the familiar coverage- and activity-based approaches to curriculum design fall short, and how a focus on the six facets of understanding can enrich student learning. With an expanded array of practical strategies, tools, and examples from all subject areas, the book demonstrates how the research-based principles of Understanding by Design apply to district frameworks as well as to individual units of curriculum. Combining provocative ideas, thoughtful analysis, and tested approaches, Understanding by Design, 2nd edition, offers teacher-designers a clear path to the creation of curriculum that ensures better learning and a more stimulating experience for students and teachers alike.","2005","2019-05-11 22:45:22","2019-05-11 22:45:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 56491025","","/Users/arindambose/Downloads/zotero_downloads/undefined/2005/wiggins_mctighe_2005_understand.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. Methods We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual-level scores of genetic risk. Results The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands-on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users. Conclusions By providing theoretical background and hands-on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.","2018","2019-05-11 05:59:34","2019-05-11 05:59:34","2019-05-11 05:59:34","e1608","","2","27","","","A tutorial on conducting genome-wide association studies","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","false; ; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\KCMASKMC\mpr.html","; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mpr.1608","","tutorial; genome-wide association study (GWAS); GitHub; PLINK; polygenic risk score (PRS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using different p-value thresholds (.1, .2 and .5) from the meta-analyses, sets of ‘risk alleles’ were defined and used to generate a polygenic risk score (weighted sum of the alleles) for each subject in an independent target sample from the Netherlands Twin Register (N=1583). The association between polygenic smoking scores and alcohol/cannabis use was investigated with regression analyses. Results—The polygenic scores for ‘cigarettes per day’ were significantly associated with, the number of glasses alcohol per week (p=.005, R2=.4–.5%) and cannabis initiation (p=.004, R2=0.6–.9%). The polygenic scores for ‘age at onset of smoking’ were significantly associated with ‘age at regular drinking’ (p=.001, R2=1.1–1.5%), while the scores for ‘smoking initiation’ and ‘smoking cessation’ did not significantly predict alcohol or cannabis use. Conclusions—Smoking, alcohol and cannabis use are influenced by aggregated genetic risk factors shared between these substances. The many common genetic variants each have a very small individual effect size.","2014-07","2019-05-11 05:35:35","2019-05-11 05:35:35","2019-05-11 05:35:35","1141-1151","","7","109","","","Polygenic risk scores for smoking","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VJTQPUHV\Vink et al. - 2014 - Polygenic risk scores for smoking predictors for .pdf; /Users/arindambose/Downloads/zotero_downloads/Addiction/2014/vink_etal_2014_polygenic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Tattoos on the Heart, he distills his experience working in the ghetto into a breathtaking series of parables inspired by faith. Arranged by theme and filled with sparkling humor and glowing generosity, these essays offer a stirring look at how full our lives could be if we could find the joy in loving others and in being loved unconditionally. From giant, tattooed Cesar, shopping at JCPenney fresh out of prison, we learn how to feel worthy of God's love. From ten-year-old Lula we learn the importance of being known and acknowledged. From Pedro we understand the kind of patience necessary to rescue someone from the darkness. In each chapter we benefit from Boyle’s gentle, hard-earned wisdom. These essays about universal kinship and redemption are moving examples of the power of unconditional love and the importance of fighting despair. Gorgeous and uplifting, Tattoos on the Heart reminds us that no life is less valuable than another.","2011-02-22","2019-05-11 04:48:29","2019-05-11 04:48:29","","","240","","","","","Tattoos on the Heart","","","","","Free Press","New York","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Tattoos-Heart-Power-Boundless-Compassion/dp/1439153159","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60840th edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With relatively modest sample and effect sizes, a true association between genotype and phenotype may never meet genome-wide statistical significance (P < 5 × 10-8) in a single study. Through meta-analysis, novel susceptibility loci can be discovered by effectively summing the statistical evidence of individually underpowered studies. Most genetic discoveries for complex traits are now made through meta-analysis collaborations, which so far have been restricted to single-locus analyses, testing for main effects at a single polymorphism at a time. A key benefit of this approach is that individual-level genotype (and phenotype) data do not need to be exchanged between research groups. In this article, we focus on meta-analysis at individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), paying particular attention to how imputation uncertainty can be incorporated into the association analysis and subsequent meta-analysis. Probably the most important aspect of genome-wide association meta-analysis is harmonization of the study results. As studies differ in design, sample collection, genotyping platforms, and association analysis methods, it is important that the association results (per SNP) of each study can be formatted, exchanged, and analyzed in such a way that the statistical evidence can be combined appropriately and that no valuable information is lost. Without minimizing the importance of having a clear phenotype definition (and corresponding measurements), we will assume that investigators representing the various studies have made sensible agreements about phenotype definitions, necessary sample exclusions, and appropriate covariate modeling.","2010-06-01","2019-05-10 14:45:24","2019-05-10 14:45:24","2019-05-10 14:45:24","pdb.top81","","6","2010","","Cold Spring Harb Protoc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","cshprotocols.cshlp.org","","PMID: 20516189","","/Users/arindambose/Downloads/zotero_downloads/Cold Spring Harbor Protocols/2010/bakker_neale_daly_2010_meta-analy.pdf; ; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\KTYSVDBQ\pdb.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20516189","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models do not address genocidal risks from ecocide. Study objectives were to assess 1) the role of Malthusian pressures in recent genocides, 2) the role of ecocide and ecologic abuse in creating these pressures, and 3) strategies for prevention and deterrence. Analysis of reports, demographic studies, and time trends in recent genocides and recent ecocidal events from ecologic abuse suggests that Malthusian pressures and zero-sum rivalries over water, arable land, or natural resources by themselves do not lead to genocide. Such pressures may have exacerbated the political and socioeconomic predictors in Rwanda and Darfur, but not in former Yugoslavia. However, collapse of socioeconomic and governmental infrastructures following genocide can leave behind massive sustained damage to carrying capacity and sustainability. Surviving victims, if they return to their environments, will remain at risk for persecution. Ecocide—the large-scale destruction, depletion, or contamination of natural ecosystems—can result in widespread damage to health, survival, fertility, reproduction, and sustenance, and forced flight. International early warning and effective response systems are needed to deter or prevent political decisions to carry out genocide. Such systems must include long-term measures to resolve zerosum conflicts over environmental resources and to prevent toxic risks to vulnerable populations and destruction of habitat by deliberate or wanton ecologic abuse, which itself should be redefined as a crime against humanity.","2007-07-01","2019-03-16 08:42:37","2020-04-18 08:14:09","2019-03-16 08:42:36","331-341","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","tex.ids: richter_malthusian_2007-1 PMID: 17915548","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\YNQ68F8S\Richter et al. - 2007 - Malthusian Pressures, Genocide, and Ecocide.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\7H5XG684\oeh.2007.13.3.html","","","Darfur; ecocide; environmental degradation; genocide; Malthusian pressures; Rwanda; Yugoslavia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior research has shown that patients with obesity perceive less favourable interactions compared with those with lower weights. This paper explores whether this association depends on patients' cumulative polygenic score with respect to genes linked to obesity (i.e. a single variable quantifying the individual's genome-wide risk factors for high body mass index [BMI] or genetic liability) and whether providers react differentially to patients whose obesity is more genetic in nature compared with patients with diabetes caused by environmental factors. Methods The association between patients' BMI category, their polygenic score for high BMI and their interaction was assessed for two measures of the patient–provider interaction within a sample of 521 older patients with diabetes from the Health and Retirement Study. Results Particularly for patients with obesity, the quality of the patient–provider interaction depended on genetic liability for high BMI controlling for demographic and clinical covariates. Providers responded less favourably to patients with diabetes influenced by environmental factors compared with individuals with high genetic liability. Conclusions Results of this study suggest that a patient's genotype may elicit particular responses from their healthcare provider. When a provider judges a patient's high BMI to be environmentally driven rather than genetically oriented, patients receive reduced quality of care.","2018-10-01","2018-10-20 03:03:26","2018-10-20 03:03:26","2018-10-20 03:03:26","448-454","","5","4","","","Provider bias as a function of patient genotype","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors.

These genetic effect sizes are almost invariably moderate to small in magnitude and single studies, even if large, are underpowered to detect them with confidence. Meta-analysis of many genome-wide association studies improves the power to detect more associations, and to investigate the consistency or heterogeneity of these associations across diverse datasets and study populations.

The Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) was established to provide the scale of data required to address these issues, aggregating longitudinal datasets curated by eight international HCM specialty centers. Methods: Data on 4591 HCM patients (2763 genotyped), followed for a mean of 5.4±6.9 years (24,791 patient-years; median [interquartile range] 2.9 [0.3-7.9] years) were analyzed regarding cardiac arrest, cardiac transplantation, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy, all-cause death, atrial fibrillation, stroke, New York Heart Association Functional Class III/IV symptoms (all comprising the overall composite endpoint), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)<35%. Outcomes were analyzed individually and as composite endpoints. Results: Median age of diagnosis was 45.8 [30.9-58.1] years and 37% of patients were female. Age of diagnosis and sarcomere mutation status were predictive of outcomes. Patients <40 years old at diagnosis had a 77% [95% confidence interval: 72%, 80%] cumulative incidence of the overall composite outcome by age 60, compared to 32% [29%, 36%] by age 70 for patients diagnosed >60 years. Young HCM patients (20-29 years) had 4-fold higher mortality than the general United States population at a similar age. Patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic sarcomere mutations had two-fold greater risk for adverse outcomes compared to patients without mutations; sarcomere variants of uncertain significance were associated with intermediate risk. Heart failure and atrial fibrillation were the most prevalent adverse events, although typically not emerging for several years after diagnosis. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 32% [23%, 40%] of patients <40 years at diagnosis, but in 1% [1%, 2%] >60 years. Conclusions: The cumulative burden of HCM is substantial and dominated by heart failure and atrial fibrillation occurring many years following diagnosis. Young age of diagnosis and the presence of a sarcomere mutation are powerful predictors of adverse outcomes. These findings highlight the need for close surveillance throughout life, and the need to develop disease-modifying therapies.","2018-10-02","2018-10-12 04:33:30","2018-10-12 04:33:30","","1387-1398","","14","138","","Circulation","Genotype and Lifetime Burden of Disease in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30297972 PMCID: PMC6170149","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30297972","","Genetics; Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; Natural history; Registry; Risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It investigates how older people understand the meaning of ""aging in place,"" a term widely used in aging policy and research but underexplored with older people themselves. DESIGN AND METHODS: Older people (n = 121), ranging in age from 56 to 92 years, participated in focus groups and interviews in 2 case study communities of similar size in Aotearoa New Zealand, both with high ratings on deprivation indices. The question, ""What is the ideal place to grow older?"" was explored, including reflections on aging in place. Thematic and narrative analyses on the meaning of aging in place are presented in this paper. RESULTS: Older people want choices about where and how they age in place. ""Aging in place"" was seen as an advantage in terms of a sense of attachment or connection and feelings of security and familiarity in relation to both homes and communities. Aging in place related to a sense of identity both through independence and autonomy and through caring relationships and roles in the places people live.

Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. OBJECTIVE: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. METHODS: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. RESULTS: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. CONCLUSION: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. \copyright 2015 S.

This increasing demand requires more residential aged care facilities and healthcare workforce. One recommended solution is to keep older people in their homes longer and support their independent life through the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). However, the aged care sector is still in the early stages of adopting ICT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the key issues that affect the adoption of ICT in the aged care sector. METHODS: A systematic literature review was undertaken and involved four steps. The first two steps aimed to identify and select relevant articles. Data was then extracted from the selected articles and identified issues were analyzed and grouped into three major categories. RESULTS: ICT adoption issues were categorized into different perspectives, representing older people, health professionals and management. Our findings showed that all three groups were mostly concerned with issues around behavior, cost and lack of technical skills. DISCU\SSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings reported in this study will help decision makers at aged care settings to systematically understand issues related to ICT adoption and thus proactively introduce interventions to improve use of ICT in this sector. On the basis of our findings, we suggest future research focus on the examination of aged care workflow and assessment of return on ICT investment. Copyright \copyright 2015.

Assistive technologies and sensors in the home environment and/or bodily worn systems that monitor people's movement might contribute to an increased sense of safety and security at home. However, their use can raise ethical anxieties as little is known about how older persons perceive assistive and monitoring technologies. OBJECTIVES: To review the main barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies (ATs) by older adults in order to uncover issues of concern from empirical studies and to arrange these issues from the most critical to the least critical. METHOD: A 4-step systematic review was conducted using empirical studies: locating and identifying relevant articles; screening of located articles; examination of full text articles for inclusion/exclusion; and detail examination of the 44 articles included. RESULTS: Privacy is a top critical concern to older adults, registering a 34% of the total articles examined. Two other equally potent barriers to the adoption of ATs were trust and functionality/added value representing 27 and 25 per cent each respectively of the total studies examined. Also of serious concerns are cost of ATs and ease of use and suitability for daily use (23%) each respectively, perception of ""no need"" (20%), stigma (18%), and fear of dependence and lack of training (16%) each respectively. These underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies such as the so-called ""gerontechnologies"" specifically targeting older adults. However, more and more older adults adopt different kinds of ATs in order to fit in with the society. CONCLUSIONS: The identified underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies. The negative attitudes that are most frequently associated with technologies such as the so-called ""gerontechnologies"" specifically targeting older adults contain stigmatizing symbolism that might prevent them from adopting them.

RESULTS: A similar proportion of respondents (nearly 30%) had either moved house recently or not for at least 20 years. Almost half were intending to stay in their current residence as they aged, this proportion increasing with age. A key reason for staying was having a 'comfortable' home. Related to moving, lifestyle change was particularly important for younger respondents and upkeep/maintenance difficulties for older respondents.

RESULTS: Elderly people approach the Internet and health information technology differently than younger people, but have growing rates of adoption. Assistive technology, such as sensors or home monitors, may help 'aging in place', but these have not been thoroughly evaluated. Elders face many barriers in using technology for healthcare decision-making, including issues with familiarity, willingness to ask for help, trust of the technology, privacy, and design challenges.

As adoption rates soar, the impact of these hazards will increase. OBJECTIVE: Over the last decade, unintended consequences have received great attention in the medical informatics literature, and this paper seeks to identify the major themes that have emerged. RESULTS: Rich typologies of the causes of unintended consequences have been developed, along with a number of explanatory frameworks based on socio-technical systems theory. We however still have only limited data on the frequency and impact of these events, as most studies rely on data sets from incident reporting or patient chart reviews, rather than undertaking detailed observational studies. Such data are increasingly needed as more organizations implement health information technologies. When outcome studies have been done in different organizations, they reveal different outcomes for identical systems. From a theoretical perspective, recent advances in the emerging discipline of implementation science have much to offer in explaining the origin, and variability, of unintended consequences. CONCLUSION: The dynamic nature of health care service organizations, and the rapid development and adoption of health information technologies means that unintended consequences are unlikely to disappear, and we therefore must commit to developing robust systems to detect and manage them.","2016-11","2019-11-07 00:27:23","2020-04-18 08:15:31","2019-11-04","163-169","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.ids: coiera_unintended_2016 PMCID: PMC5171576 PMID: 27830246","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is limited research examining the information needs of older adults' informal support networks and how these could be met through home monitoring and information and communication technologies. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how technologies that connect older adults to their informal and formal support networks could assist aging in place and enhance older adults' health and well-being. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 older adults and a total of 31 members of their self-identified informal support networks. They were asked questions about their information needs and how technology could support the older adults to age in place. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The analysis identified three overarching themes: (1) the social enablers theme, which outlined how timing, informal support networks, and safety concerns assist the older adults' uptake of technology, (2) the technology concerns theme, which outlined concerns about cost, usability, information security and privacy, and technology superseding face-to-face contact, and (3) the information desired theme, which outlined what information should be collected and transferred and who should make decisions about this. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults and their informal support networks may be receptive to technology that monitors older adults within the home if it enables aging in place for longer. However, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers would need to be considered and the system should be individualizable to older adults' changing needs. The user requirements identified from this study and described in this paper have informed the development of a technology that is currently being prototyped. \copyrightPhoebe Elers, Inga Hunter, Dick Whiddett, Caroline Lockhart, Hans Guesgen, Amardeep Singh.

Patients benefit from disease self-management tools, contact to others, and closer monitoring. Researchers study drug efficiency, or recruit patients for clinical studies via these technologies. However, low communication barriers in socialmedia, limited privacy and security issues lead to problems from an ethical perspective. This paper summarizes the ethical issues to be considered when social media is exploited in healthcare contexts. METHODS: Starting from our experiences in social-media research, we collected ethical issues for selected social-media use cases in the context of patient-centered care. Results were enriched by collecting and analyzing relevant literature and were discussed and interpreted by members of the IMIA Social Media Working Group. RESULTS: Most relevant issues in social-media applications are confidence and privacy that need to be carefully preserved. The patient-physician relationship can suffer from the new information gain on both sides since private information of both healthcare provider and consumer may be accessible through the Internet. Physicians need to ensure they keep the borders between private and professional intact. Beyond, preserving patient anonymity when citing Internet content is crucial for research studies. CONCLUSION: Exploiting medical social-media in healthcare applications requires a careful reflection of roles and responsibilities. Availability of data and information can be useful in many settings, but the abuse of data needs to be prevented. Preserving privacy and confidentiality of online users is a main issue, as well as providing means for patients or Internet users to express concerns on data usage.","2015-08","2019-11-07 00:29:27","2019-11-07 00:29:27","2019-11-03","137-147","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 26293861 PMCID: PMC4587037","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through its reports and recommendations, CEJA is responsible for maintaining and updating the AMA Code of Medical Ethics (Code). CEJA reports are developed through an iterative process of deliberation with input from multiple stakeholders; report recommendations, once adopted by the AMA House of Delegates, become ethics policy of the AMA and are issued as Opinions in the Code. To provide enduring guidance for the medical profession as a whole, CEJA strives to articulate expectations for conduct that are as independent of specific technologies or models of practice as possible. The present report, developed at the request of the House of Delegates, provides broad guidance for ethical conduct relating to key issues in telehealth/telemedicine. The report and recommendations were debated at meetings of the House in June and November 2015; recommendations were adopted in June 2016 and published as Opinion E-1.2.12, Ethical Practice in Telemedicine, in November 2016.

Technology such as telehealth is a critical part of connected healthcare. However, exchanging health information brings the risk of privacy issues. To better manage privacy risks we first need to understand the different patterns of patient-centred care in order to tailor solutions to address privacy risks. METHODS: Drawing upon published literature, we develop a business model to enable patient-centred care via telehealth. The model identifies three patient-centred connected health patterns. We then use the patterns to analyse potential privacy risks and possible solutions from different types of telehealth delivery. RESULTS: Connected healthcare raises the risk of unwarranted access to health data and related invasion of privacy. However, the risk and extent of privacy issues differ according to the pattern of patient-centred care delivery and the type of particular challenge as they enable the highest degree of connectivity and thus the greatest potential for privacy breaches. CONCLUSION: Privacy issues are a major concern in telehealth systems and patients, providers, and administrators need to be aware of these privacy issues and have guidance on how to manage them. This paper integrates patient-centred connected health care, telehealth, and privacy risks to provide an understanding of how risks vary across different patterns of patient-centred connected health and different types of telehealth delivery.

An increased use of technology increases the importance of the ethical issues involved. The need for keeping patients' information confidential and secure, controlling a number of therapists' inefficiency as well as raising the quality of healthcare services necessitates adequate heed to ethical issues in telemedicine provision. Aim: The goal of this review is gathering all articles that are published through 5 years until now (2012-2017) for detecting ethical issues for providing telemedicine services and Information technology. The reason of this time is improvement of telemedicine and technology through these years. This article is important for clinical practice and also to world, because of knowing ethical issues in telemedicine and technology are always important factors for physician and health providers. Material and methods: the required data in this research were derived from published electronic sources and credible academic articles published in such databases as PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct. The following key words were searched for in separation and combination: tele-health, telemedicine, ethical issues in telemedicine. A total of 503 articles were found. After excluding the duplicates (n= 93), the titles and abstracts of 410 articles were skimmed according to the inclusion criteria. Finally, 64 articles remained. They were reviewed in full text and 36 articles were excluded. At the end, 28 articles were chosen which met our eligibility criteria and were included in this study. Results: Ethics has been of a great significance in IT and telemedicine especially the Internet since there are more chances provided for accessing information. It is, however, accompanied by a threat to patients' personal information. Therefore, suggestions are made to investigate ethics in technology, to offer standards and guidelines to therapists. Due to the advancement in technology, access to information has become simpler than the past. This has prompted hackers to seize the opportunity. Discussion: This research shows that the ethical issues in telemedicine can be investigated from several aspects like technology, doctor-patient relationship, data confidentiality and security, informed consent, patient's and family's satisfaction with telemedicine services. Following ethical issues in telemedicine is a primary aspect of high quality services. In other words, if therapists abide by ethical rules, they can provide better services for patients. Attention to ethical issues in telemedicine guarantees a safer use of the services.","2017-10","2019-11-07 00:29:30","2019-11-07 00:29:30","2019-10-14","351-355","","5","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29284905 PMCID: PMC5723167","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this shortcoming, we conducted a literature review to develop a framework for considering UICs and health information technology (HIT) from the perspective of OSIs. METHODS: A literature review was conducted for the period 2000- 2015 using the search terms ""unintended consequences"" and ""health information technology"". 67 papers were screened, of which 18 met inclusion criteria. Data extraction was focused on the types of technologies studied, types of UICs identified, and methods of data collection and analysis used. A thematic analysis was used to identify themes related to UICs. RESULTS: We identified two overarching themes. One was the definition and terminology of how people classify and discuss UICs. Second was OSIs and UICs. For the OSI theme, we also identified four sub-themes: process change and evolution, individual-collaborative interchange, context of use, and approaches to model, study, and understand UICs. CONCLUSIONS: While there is a wide body of research on UICs, there is a lack of overall consensus on how they should be classified and reported, limiting our ability to understand the implications of UICs and how to manage them. More mixed-methods research and better proactive identification of UICs remain priorities. Our findings and framework of OSI considerations for studying UICs and HIT extend existing work on HIT and UICs by focusing on organizational and social issues.","2016-11","2019-11-07 00:29:32","2019-11-07 00:29:32","2019-11-04","53-60","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 27830231 PMCID: PMC5171563","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A case-control study to investigate direction of causality","The British Journal of Psychiatry: The Journal of Mental Science","","0007-1250","10.1192/bjp.176.2.132","","BACKGROUND: Robust evidence that anorexia nervosa is preceded rather than accompanied by high-concern (overprotective) parenting is limited. AIMS: To look for evidence of parental high concern occurring before any onset of disorder. METHOD: Forty consecutive referrals of adolescent girls with DSM-III-R anorexia nervosa were compared with matched controls using obstetric records and maternal interviews. RESULTS: Index mothers reported higher rates of: near-exclusive child care (P = 0.02), infant sleep difficulties (P = 0.018), severe distress at first regular separation (P = 0.048), high maternal trait anxiety levels (P = 0.008) and later age for first sleeping away from home (P = 0.009). More index families had experienced a severe obstetric loss prior to their daughter's birth (P = 0.066). CONCLUSIONS: This study lends evidence to the clinical contention that high-concern parenting in infancy is associated with the later development of anorexia nervosa. This may derive, in part, from aspects of unresolved grief.","2000-02","2019-11-08 02:45:59","2019-11-08 02:45:59","","132-137","","","176","","Br J Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10755049","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\WL8B8ZFQ\shoebridge_gowers_2000_parental_high_concern_and_adolescent-onset_anorexia_nervosa.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10755049","","Female; Humans; Case-Control Studies; Adolescent; Pregnancy; Abortion, Spontaneous; Anorexia Nervosa; Anxiety; Mother-Child Relations; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Pregnancy Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We used pooled information from the SYNERGY project including 14 case-control studies conducted in Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and China, with lifetime work histories and smoking habits for 14,748 cases of lung cancer and 17,543 controls. We estimated odds ratios by unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for smoking and having ever been employed in a job known to present an excess risk of lung cancer. RESULTS: There was no increased lung cancer risk overall or by specific cell type among firefighters (n = 190), neither before nor after smoking adjustment. We observed no significant exposure-response relationship in terms of work duration. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an excess lung cancer risk related to occupational exposure as a firefighter.","2016","2019-11-08 02:44:03","2019-11-08 02:44:03","","1137-1143","","11","58","","J.

This study was conducted to clarify if there is an association between prediagnostic serum Se levels and breast cancer risk. A population based cohort, the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study, was used and linked with the Swedish cancer registry up to 31 December 2013. Our study included 1,186 women with breast cancer and an equal number of controls. Selenium levels were analysed from stored serum samples. The included individuals were divided into quartiles based on Se value and we compared breast cancer cases with controls using logistic regression yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Serum Se was also analysed as a continuous variable regarding breast cancer risk. The analyses were adjusted for established risk factors and stratified on smoking status and body mass index (BMI). When comparing the highest Se quartile with the lowest, the adjusted OR for breast cancer was 0.98 (0.75-1.26). With selenium as a continuous variable the adjusted OR was 1.00 (1.00-1.01) per 10 ng/ml. When comparing the highest with the lowest Se quartile in women with BMI > 25 kg/m2 the adjusted OR was 0.77 (0.53-1.14). We conclude that it is unlikely that prediagnostic serum selenium is overall associated with breast cancer risk and no modifying effect from BMI or smoking was seen.","2017","2019-11-08 02:44:03","2019-11-08 02:44:03","","1741-1750","","9","141","","Int.

Treatment studies have been published, but pressure to establish public policy requires an updated systematic review of cannabis‐specific treatments for adults. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder (compared with inactive control and/or alternative treatment) delivered to adults in an out‐patient or community setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulaive Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and reference lists of articles. Searched literature included all articles published before July 2015. Selection criteria All randomised controlled studies examining a psychosocial intervention for cannabis use disorder (without pharmacological intervention) in comparison with a minimal or inactive treatment control or alternative combinations of psychosocial interventions. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included 23 randomised controlled trials involving 4045 participants. A total of 15 studies took place in the United States, two in Australia, two in Germany and one each in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil and Ireland. Investigators delivered treatments over approximately seven sessions (range, one to 14) for approximately 12 weeks (range, one to 56). Overall, risk of bias across studies was moderate, that is, no trial was at high risk of selection bias, attrition bias or reporting bias. Further, trials included a large total number of participants, and each trial ensured the fidelity of treatments provided. In contrast, because of the nature of the interventions provided, participant blinding was not possible, and reports of researcher blinding often were unclear or were not provided. Half of the reviewed studies included collateral verification or urinalysis to confirm self report data, leading to concern about performance and detection bias. Finally, concerns of other bias were based on relatively consistent lack of assessment of non‐cannabis substance use or use of additional treatments before or during the trial period. A subset of studies provided sufficient detail for comparison of effects of any intervention versus inactive control on primary outcomes of interest at early follow‐up (median, four months). Results showed moderate‐quality evidence that approximately seven out of 10 intervention participants completed treatment as intended (effect size (ES) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.78, 11 studies, 1424 participants), and that those receiving psychosocial intervention used cannabis on fewer days compared with those given inactive control (mean difference (MD) 5.67, 95% CI 3.08 to 8.26, six studies, 1144 participants). In addition, low‐quality evidence revealed that those receiving intervention were more likely to report point‐prevalence abstinence (risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.83, six studies, 1166 participants) and reported fewer symptoms of dependence (standardised mean difference (SMD) 4.15, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.63, four studies, 889 participants) and cannabis‐related problems compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3.34, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.42, six studies, 2202 participants). Finally, very low‐quality evidence indicated that those receiving intervention reported using fewer joints per day compared with those given inactive control (SMD 3.55, 95% CI 2.51 to 4.59, eight studies, 1600 participants). Notably, subgroup analyses found that interventions of more than four sessions delivered over longer than one month (high intensity) produced consistently improved outcomes (particularly in terms of cannabis use frequency and severity of dependence) in the short term as compared with low‐intensity interventions. The most consistent evidence supports the use of cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and particularly their combination for assisting with reduction of cannabis use frequency at early follow‐up (MET: MD 4.45, 95% CI 1.90 to 7.00, four studies, 612 participants; CBT: MD 10.94, 95% CI 7.44 to 14.44, one study, 134 participants; MET + CBT: MD 7.38, 95% CI 3.18 to 11.57, three studies, 398 participants) and severity of dependence (MET: SMD 4.07, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.17, two studies, 316 participants; MET + CBT: SMD 7.89, 95% CI 0.93 to 14.85, three studies, 573 participants), although no particular intervention was consistently effective at nine‐month follow‐up or later. In addition, data from five out of six studies supported the utility of adding voucher‐based incentives for cannabis‐negative urines to enhance treatment effect on cannabis use frequency. A single study found contrasting results throughout a 12‐month follow‐up period, as post‐treatment outcomes related to overall reduction in cannabis use frequency favoured CBT alone without the addition of abstinence‐based or treatment adherence‐based contingency management. In contrast, evidence of drug counselling, social support, relapse prevention and mindfulness meditation was weak because identified studies were few, information on treatment outcomes insufficient and rates of treatment adherence low. In line with treatments for other substance use, abstinence rates were relatively low overall, with approximately one‐quarter of participants abstinent at final follow‐up. Finally, three studies found that intervention was comparable with treatment as usual among participants in psychiatric clinics and reported no between‐group differences in any of the included outcomes. Authors' conclusions Included studies were heterogeneous in many aspects, and important questions regarding the most effective duration, intensity and type of intervention were raised and partially resolved. Generalisability of findings was unclear, most notably because of the limited number of localities and homogeneous samples of treatment seekers. The rate of abstinence was low and unstable although comparable with treatments for other substance use. Psychosocial intervention was shown, in comparison with minimal treatment controls, to reduce frequency of use and severity of dependence in a fairly durable manner, at least in the short term. Among the included intervention types, an intensive intervention provided over more than four sessions based on the combination of MET and CBT with abstinence‐based incentives was most consistently supported for treatment of cannabis use disorder. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder Background Cannabis use disorder is the most common illegal substance use disorder in the general population. Despite the large number of cannabis users seeking treatment, clinical trials conducted to explore the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for cannabis use disorder are rare. Study characteristics Review authors included a total of 23 studies involving 4045 adult participants who used cannabis frequently. This review included participant groups made up of at least 70% daily or near daily users, or reported to have cannabis use disorder, or seeking treatment for cannabis use. Average age of participants was 28.2 years. Most participants were male (72.5% on average, excluding two trials that recruited only females). Most (15) studies were conducted in the USA, two in Germany, two in Australia and one each in Brazil, Canada, Switzerland and Ireland. Studies compared seven different intervention types: cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational intervention (MET), a combination of MET and CBT (MET + CBT), contingency management (CM), social support (SS), mindfulness‐based meditation (MM) and drug education and counselling (DC). Key findings Similar to other illicit drug disorders, cannabis use disorder is not easily treated by psychosocial interventions provided in out‐patient and community settings. CBT in individual and group sessions and MET in individual sessions were the most consistently explored treatments; they have demonstrated effectiveness over control conditions. In particular, psychosocial treatment was consistently effective over no treatment in reducing the frequency of cannabis use (with nine studies showing superior outcomes and four showing comparable outcomes), quantity used per occasion (seven studies showing superior outcomes and two showing comparable outcomes) and severity of dependence (with seven studies showing superior outcomes and two showing comparable outcomes). In contrast, treatment was not likely to be more effective than no treatment in improving cannabis‐related problems (with four studies showing superior outcomes and seven showing comparable outcomes), motivation to quit (with no studies showing superior outcomes and three showing comparable outcomes), other substance use (with no studies showing superior outcomes and seven showing comparable outcomes) or mental health (with no studies showing superior outcomes and five showing comparable outcomes). Comparison of studies reporting treatment gains was possible for a subset of studies with short‐term follow‐up of approximately four months. This analysis found that those receiving any intervention reported fewer days of cannabis use, used fewer joints per day and reported fewer symptoms of dependence and fewer cannabis‐related problems. High‐intensity interventions of more than four sessions and those delivered over longer than one month, particularly MET + CBT interventions, were most effective. In addition, interventions were completed as intended by most participants. Notably, three studies investigated the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention compared with treatment as usual delivered at psychiatric out‐patient centres and reported little evidence of significant group differences in treatment outcomes. Finally, results from six studies, which included contingency management adjunct treatments, were mixed but suggested that improvements in cannabis use frequency and severity of dependence were likely when combined with CBT or with MET + CBT. Invesigators reported no adverse effects. Quality of evidence Evidence is current to July 2015. Two review authors (Le Foll and Copeland) received donations of nabiximols (Sativex) from GW Pharma, although no review authors received direct funding to complete this review. The quality of evidence among primary outcomes was very low to moderate and suffered serious limitations, as no trial assessed all treatment outcomes of interest, and variability among included measures was great. In addition, assessment of other substance use, including tobacco use, or use of additional treatments during the trial period was scarce. Participant drop‐out was also a concern; on average, more than 20% of participants across studies were lost at final follow‐up, but most studies addressed attrition bias via appropriate analysis plans. In contrast, we found little evidence of selective reporting or selection bias.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:59","2020-04-18 08:14:43","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Gates06 tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; *Ambulatory Care; *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Marijuana Abuse [psychology; Motivational Interviewing; #duplicate-citation-key","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review examined currently available evidence on the use of relaxation therapies for pain management in labour. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. Objectives To examine the effects of mind‐body relaxation techniques for pain management in labour on maternal and neonatal well‐being during and after labour. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (9 May 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 5 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 May 2017), CINAHL (1980 to 24 May 2017), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (18 May 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (18 May 2017), the ISRCTN Register (18 May 2017), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (18 May 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (including quasi randomised and cluster trials) comparing relaxation methods with standard care, no treatment, other non‐pharmacological forms of pain management in labour or placebo. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We attempted to contact study authors for additional information. We assessed evidence quality with GRADE methodology. Main results This review update includes 19 studies (2519 women), 15 of which (1731 women) contribute data. Interventions examined included relaxation, yoga, music and mindfulness. Approximately half of the studies had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation and attrition bias. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias for performance and detection bias, and unclear risk of bias for, allocation concealment, reporting bias and other bias. We assessed the evidence from these studies as ranging from low to very low quality, and therefore the effects below should be interpreted with caution. Relaxation We found that relaxation compared to usual care provided lowered the intensity of pain (measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with low scores indicating less pain) during the latent phase of labour (mean difference (MD) ‐1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.97 to ‐0.53, one trial, 40 women). Four trials reported pain intensity in the active phase; there was high heterogeneity between trials and very low‐quality evidence suggested that there was no strong evidence that the effects were any different between groups for this outcome (MD ‐1.08, 95% CI ‐2.57 to 0.41, four trials, 271 women, random‐effects analysis). Very low‐quality evidence showed that women receiving relaxation reported greater satisfaction with pain relief during labour (risk ratio (RR) 8.00, 95% CI 1.10 to 58.19, one trial, 40 women), and showed no clear benefit for satisfaction with childbirth experience (assessed using different scales) (standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.31, three trials, 1176 women). For safety outcomes there was very low‐quality evidence of no clear reduction in assisted vaginal birth (average RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.84, four trials, 1122 women) or in caesarean section rates (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.01, four trials, 1122 women). Sense of control in labour, and breastfeeding were not reported under this comparison. Yoga When comparing yoga to control interventions there was low‐quality evidence that yoga lowered pain intensity (measured on a scale of 0 to 10) with low scores indicating less pain) (MD ‐6.12, 95% CI ‐11.77 to ‐0.47, one trial, 66 women), greater satisfaction with pain relief (MD 7.88, 95% CI 1.51 to 14.25, one trial, 66 women) and greater satisfaction with childbirth experience (MD 6.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 12.42 one trial, 66 women (assessed using the Maternal Comfort Scale with higher score indicating greater comfort). Sense of control in labour, breastfeeding, assisted vaginal birth, and caesarean section were not reported under this comparison. Music When comparing music to control interventions there was evidence of lower pain intensity in the latent phase for women receiving music (measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with low scores indicating less pain) (MD ‐0.73, 95% CI ‐1.01 to ‐0.45, random‐effects analysis, two trials, 192 women) and very low‐quality evidence of no clear benefit in the active phase (MD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐1.10 to 0.07, three trials, 217 women). Very low‐quality evidence suggested no clear benefit in terms of reducing assisted vaginal birth (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.05, one trial, 156 women) or caesarean section rate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.70, two trials, 216 women). Satisfaction with pain relief, sense of control in labour, satisfaction with childbirth experience, and breastfeeding were not reported under this comparison. Audio analgesia One trial evaluating audio analgesia versus control only reported one outcome and showed no evidence of benefit in satisfaction with pain relief. Mindfulness One trial evaluating mindfulness versus usual care found an increase in sense of control for the mindfulness group (using the Childbirth Self‐Efficacy Inventory) (MD 31.30, 95% CI 1.61 to 60.99, 26 women). There is no strong evidence that the effects were any different between groups for satisfaction in childbirth, or for caesarean section rate, need for assisted vaginal delivery or need for pharmacological pain relief. No other outcomes were reported in this trial. Authors' conclusions Relaxation, yoga and music may have a role with reducing pain, and increasing satisfaction with pain relief, although the quality of evidence varies between very low to low. There was insufficient evidence for the role of mindfulness and audio‐analgesia. The majority of trials did not report on the safety of the interventions. Further randomised controlled trials of relaxation modalities for pain management in labour are needed. Trials should be adequately powered and include clinically relevant outcomes such as those described in this review. Plain language summary Relaxation techniques for pain management in labour What is the issue? This Cochrane Review looked at whether mind‐body techniques for relaxation such as breathing techniques, visualisation, yoga or music would help with reducing pain, and improve women’s experiences of labour. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question (date of search: May 2017). Why is this important? The pain of labour can be intense, with body tension, anxiety and fear making it worse. Many women would like to go through labour without using drugs, or invasive methods such as an epidural. These women often turn to complementary therapies to help to reduce the intensity of pain in labour and improve their experiences of labour. Many complementary therapies are used by women in labour, including acupuncture, mind‐body techniques, massage, reflexology, herbal medicines or homoeopathy, hypnosis, music and aromatherapy. Mind‐body techniques for relaxation can be widely accessible to women through the teaching of these techniques during antenatal classes. The relaxation techniques include guided imagery, progressive relaxation and breathing techniques. We also include yoga and music in this review. Other Cochrane Reviews cover hypnosis in labour, manual methods (like massage and reflexology), aromatherapy and acupuncture/acupressure. Many of these relaxation techniques are coping strategies used to reduce the experience of pain. These techniques utilise practices that aim to reduce stress and reduce the perception of pain. It is important to examine if these therapies work and are safe, to enable women to make informed decisions about their care. What evidence did we find? We found 15 studies involving 1731 women that contributed data to the analyses. Studies were undertaken across the world, including countries in Europe and Scandinavia, and Iran, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and USA. We found that relaxation techniques, yoga and music may help women manage labour pain, although the quality of the evidence varied between low and very low, and more data are needed. Also, in these trials there were variations in how these techniques were used. There was no clear evidence that these therapies had an impact on assisted vaginal or caesarean birth. There were insufficient data to say if these techniques influenced the baby’s condition at birth. What does this mean? The use of some relaxation therapies, yoga, or music may possibly be helpful with reducing the intensity of pain, and in helping women feel more in control and satisfied with their labours. However, the wide variations in types of techniques used in these studies make it difficult to say specifically what might help women. Therefore further research studies are needed.","2018","2019-10-02 22:49:59","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Smith11","","","","Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Analgesia; Cesarean Section [statistics & numerical data]; Labor Pain [*therapy]; Mindfulness; Music Therapy; Obstetrical [*methods]; Pain Management [*methods]; Pain Measurement; Patient Satisfaction; Relaxation Therapy [*methods]; Supine Position; Yoga","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has also been unclear what effect, if any, goal setting has on health outcomes after rehabilitation. Objectives To assess the effects of goal setting and strategies to enhance the pursuit of goals (i.e. how goals and progress towards goals are communicated, used, or shared) on improving health outcomes in adults with acquired disability participating in rehabilitation. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, four other databases and three trials registers to December 2013, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We did not impose any language or date restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and quasi‐RCTs evaluating the effects of goal setting or strategies to enhance goal pursuit in the context of adult rehabilitation for acquired disability. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed search results for inclusion. Grey literature searches were conducted and reviewed by a single author. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We included 39 studies (27 RCTs, 6 cluster‐RCTs, and 6 quasi‐RCTs) involving 2846 participants in total. Studies ranged widely regarding clinical context and participants' primary health conditions. The most common health conditions included musculoskeletal disorders, brain injury, chronic pain, mental health conditions, and cardiovascular disease. Eighteen studies compared goal setting, with or without strategies to enhance goal pursuit, to no goal setting. These studies provide very low quality evidence that including any type of goal setting in the practice of adult rehabilitation is better than no goal setting for health‐related quality of life or self‐reported emotional status (8 studies; 446 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.88, indicative of a moderate effect size) and self‐efficacy (3 studies; 108 participants; SMD 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.49, indicative of a moderate to large effect size). The evidence is inconclusive regarding whether goal setting results in improvements in social participation or activity levels, body structure or function, or levels of patient engagement in the rehabilitation process. Insufficient data are available to determine whether or not goal setting is associated with more or fewer adverse events compared to no goal setting. Fourteen studies compared structured goal setting approaches, with or without strategies to enhance goal pursuit, to 'usual care' that may have involved some goal setting but where no structured approach was followed. These studies provide very low quality evidence that more structured goal setting results in higher patient self‐efficacy (2 studies; 134 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.71, indicative of a small effect size) and low quality evidence for greater satisfaction with service delivery (5 studies; 309 participants; SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.56, indicative of a small effect size). The evidence was inconclusive regarding whether more structured goal setting approaches result in higher health‐related quality of life or self‐reported emotional status, social participation, activity levels, or improvements in body structure or function. Three studies in this group reported on adverse events (death, re‐hospitalisation, or worsening symptoms), but insufficient data are available to determine whether structured goal setting is associated with more or fewer adverse events than usual care. A moderate degree of heterogeneity was observed in outcomes across all studies, but an insufficient number of studies was available to permit subgroup analysis to explore the reasons for this heterogeneity. The review also considers studies which investigate the effects of different approaches to enhancing goal pursuit, and studies which investigate different structured goal setting approaches. It also reports on secondary outcomes including goal attainment and healthcare utilisation. Authors' conclusions There is some very low quality evidence that goal setting may improve some outcomes for adults receiving rehabilitation for acquired disability. The best of this evidence appears to favour positive effects for psychosocial outcomes (i.e. health‐related quality of life, emotional status, and self‐efficacy) rather than physical ones. Due to study limitations, there is considerable uncertainty regarding these effects however, and further research is highly likely to change reported estimates of effect. Plain language summary Goal setting for adults receiving clinical rehabilitation for disability Background Goal setting is considered a key part of clinical rehabilitation for adults with disability, such as in rehabilitation following brain injuries, heart or lung diseases, mental health illnesses, or for injuries or illnesses involving bones and muscles. Health professionals use goals to provide targets for themselves and their clients to work towards. In this review we summarise studies that have investigated what effect, if any, goal setting activities have on achieving good health outcomes following rehabilitation. Results This review found 39 studies published before December 2013, involving a total of 2846 participants receiving rehabilitation in a variety of countries and clinical situations. The studies used a wide range of different approaches to goal setting and tested the effectiveness of these approaches in a number of different ways. Overall these studies provide very low quality evidence that goal setting helps patients achieve a higher quality of life or sense of well‐being and a higher belief in their own ability to achieve goals that they choose to pursue. There is currently no consistent evidence that goal setting improves people's functional abilities after rehabilitation or how hard they try with therapeutic interventions during rehabilitation. Insufficient information exists to say whether goal setting increases or reduces the risk of adverse events (such as death or re‐hospitalisation) for people involved in rehabilitation. Because of the variety of approaches to studying goal setting in rehabilitation and because of limitations in the design of many studies completed to date, it is very possible that future studies could change the conclusions of this review. We also need more research to improve our understanding of how components of the goal setting process (such as how difficult goals are, how goals of therapy should be selected and prioritised, how goals are used in clinical practice, and how feedback on progress towards goals should be provided) contribute or do not contribute to better health outcomes.","2015","2019-10-02 22:49:59","2020-04-18 06:35:12","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *Goals; Disabled Persons [*rehabilitation]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These reviews all contribute to an overview of systematic reviews of pain management for women in labour, and share a generic protocol. This review updates an earlier version of the review of the same title. Objectives To examine the effectiveness and safety of hypnosis for pain management during labour and childbirth. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (30 September 2015) and the reference lists of primary studies and review articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTS comparing preparation for labour using hypnosis and/or use of hypnosis during labour, with or without concurrent use of pharmacological or non‐pharmacological pain relief methods versus placebo, no treatment or any analgesic drug or technique. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Where possible we contacted study authors seeking additional information about data and methodology. Main results We included nine trials randomising a total of 2954 women. The risk of bias in trials was variable, there were several well‐designed large trials and some trials where little was reported about trial design. Although eight of the nine trials assessed antenatal hypnotherapy, there were considerable differences between these trials in timing and technique. One trial provided hypnotherapy during labour. In this updated review we compared hypnosis interventions with all control groups (main comparison) and also with specific control conditions: standard care (nine RCTs), supportive counselling (two RCTs) and relaxation training (two RCTs). In the main comparison, women in the hypnosis group were less likely to use pharmacological pain relief or analgesia than those in the control groups, (average risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94, eight studies, 2916 women; very low‐quality evidence; random‐effects model). There were no clear differences between women in the hypnosis group and those in the control groups for most of the other primary outcomes. There were no clear differences for sense of coping with labour (MD 0.22, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.58, one study, 420 women; low‐quality evidence ) or spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.32, six studies, 2361 women; low‐quality evidence; random‐effects model). There were no clear differences for satisfaction with pain relief (measured on a seven‐point scale two weeks postnatally) for women in the hypnosis group who also received pethidine (MD 0.41, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 1.27; one study, 72 women), Entonox (MD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.57; one study, 357 women), self‐hypnosis (MD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.88; one study, 160 women), or epidural (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 0.34; one study, 127 women), but a slight benefit in favour of hypnosis was seen for women who received water immersion (MD 0.52, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.00; one study, 174 women (all low‐quality evidence ). There were no clear differences for satisfaction with pain relief when it was measured as the number of women who reported they had adequate pain relief (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20, one study, 264 women; low‐quality evidence ). It should be noted that for pharmacological pain relief and spontaneous vaginal birth, there was evidence of considerable statistical heterogeneity, which could not be fully explained by subgroup analysis. For this review's secondary outcomes, no clear differences were found between women in the hypnosis group and women in the control groups for most outcomes where data were available. There was mixed evidence regarding benefits for women in the hypnosis group compared with all control groups for pain intensity, satisfaction with childbirth experience and postnatal depression. For each of these outcomes, data from more than one trial were available for analysis but could not be combined due to differences in measurement methods. There was evidence that fewer women in the hypnosis group stayed in hospital for more than two days after the birth but this finding was based on one small study (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.83). No clear differences between women in the hypnosis group and the control groups were found for the other secondary outcomes where data were available. In the comparisons of hypnosis with specific types of control conditions: standard care, supportive counselling and relaxation training, there were no clear differences found between women in the hypnosis group and those in the standard care control groups or the relaxation control groups for the primary outcomes. Compared with the women in the supportive counselling control group, women in the hypnosis group were less likely to use pharmacological analgesia (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.73, two studies, 562 women). They were also more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.07), although this finding was based on the results of one small study. Overall these new comparisons displayed much less statistical heterogeneity than the comparison including all control groups. Authors' conclusions There are still only a relatively small number of studies assessing the use of hypnosis for labour and childbirth. Hypnosis may reduce the overall use of analgesia during labour, but not epidural use. No clear differences were found between women in the hypnosis group and those in the control groups for satisfaction with pain relief, sense of coping with labour or spontaneous vaginal birth. Not enough evidence currently exists regarding satisfaction with pain relief or sense of coping with labour and we would encourage any future research to prioritise the measurement of these outcomes. The evidence for the main comparison was assessed using GRADE as being of low quality for all the primary outcomes with downgrading decisions due to concerns regarding inconsistency of the evidence, limitations in design and imprecision. Further research is needed in the form of large, well‐designed randomised controlled trials to assess whether hypnosis is of value for pain management during labour and childbirth. Plain language summary Hypnosis for pain management during labour and childbirth What is the issue? Women's experiences of pain in labour are variable and complex. Techniques such as hypnosis have been proposed as ways to help women cope with pain during labour. Hypnosis represents an aspect of conscious awareness similar to daydreaming and involves focusing attention inwards and increased responsiveness to suggestions. Suggestions are verbal and non‐verbal communications, that may influence perceptions (such as the way contractions are experienced), mood or behaviour. During childbirth women may use hypnosis in a range of ways; to promote relaxation, as a means of dissociating from pain or to change their perceptions, for example, perceIving contractions as a way to get closer to birthing their baby rather than an experience of pain and suffering more usually associated with injury and disability. Women can be guided into hypnosis by a practitioner during labour or individuals can learn self‐hypnosis during pregnancy, for subsequent use during labour. This training on how to use hypnosis during the pregnancy is sometimes supplemented by audio recordings of hypnotic suggestions. Why is it important? Childbirth is a major physical, emotional and social event in a woman's life. The experience and management of pain during labour are important issues for many women. What evidence did we find? We included nine trials that randomised 2954 women to hypnosis or to control groups receiving; standard care, relaxation training or supportive counselling. In eight trials the women were trained in self‐hypnosis during pregnancy for later use during labour. In the other trial, the hypnotherapist was present during the woman's labour. There were no clear differences between women in the hypnosis group and those in the control groups in terms of the number of normal deliveries, women's satisfaction with the method of pain relief or women's sense of coping with labour. However, fewer women in the hypnosis group used pain relief medication for labour. Epidural use did not differ between the groups. All the evidence for these outcomes was found to be of low quality. The studies measured a range of other outcomes and no consistent differences were found. What does this mean? Hypnosis may reduce the overall use of pain medication during labour, but does not seem to reduce the use of epidurals. Women using hypnosis are no more likely to have a normal vaginal birth. There is currently not enough evidence to say whether hypnosis helps women feel more satisfied about their pain relief in labour, nor whether it improves their sense of coping with labour. Further high‐quality research is needed and should include assessment of women's satisfaction with pain relief and sense of coping in labour. Our conclusions about the impact hypnosis has on pain during labour and childbirth may change with future, high‐quality research.","2016","2019-10-02 22:50:00","2020-04-18 06:35:28","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Female; Humans; Time Factors; Pregnancy; Labor; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Analgesia; Obstetrical [*methods]; Patient Satisfaction; Hypnosis [*methods]; Labor Pain [psychology; Length of Stay; Obstetric [psychology]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine the efficacy of yoga delivered as a package of care versus standard care. Objectives To examine the effects of yoga as a package of care versus standard care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (latest 30 March 2017) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PsychINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga as a package of care with standard‐care control. Data collection and analysis The review authors independently selected studies, quality rated these, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk difference (RD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its CI. We employed mixed‐effect and fixed‐effect models for analysis. We examined heterogeneity (I 2 technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results Three studies are included in this review. All outcomes were short term (less than eight weeks). Useable data were reported for two outcomes only; leaving the study early and quality of life. There was some evidence in favour of the yoga package for quality of life endpoint scores (1 RCT, n=80, MD 22.93 CI 19.74 to 26.12, low‐quality evidence). Leaving the study early data were equivocal between the treatment groups (3 RCTs, n=193, RD 0.06 CI ‐0.01 to 0.13, medium‐quality evidence, high heterogeneity). Overall, this review has an inordinate number of missing key outcomes, which included mental and global state, social functioning, physical health, adverse effects and costs of care. Authors' conclusions A small number of small studies were included in this review and these lacked many key outcomes. The sparse data means we cannot state with any degree of certainty if yoga delivered as a package of care is beneficial in comparison to standard care. Plain language summary Yoga as a package of care versus standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga, delivered as part of a larger package of care, effective for people with schizophrenia compared with standard care? Background Yoga involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise for reduction of stress and promotion of health and feelings of well‐being. Schizophrenia is a mental illness where people experience symptoms such as hearing voices that are not there, poor emotional response and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia often affects people for long periods of their life and is treated primarily by antipsychotic medications. However, these medications are not always fully effective and some research suggests that yoga as an add‐on treatment could be beneficial and help improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga can be combined with other therapies such as counselling or other forms of exercise into a 'package of care'. Study characteristics Only three short‐term studies (lasting eight weeks) that randomised people with schizophrenia to either receive sessions of yoga as a package of care or standard care could be included in this review. Yoga was combined with drama, music and dance in one study, with a motivational and feedback session in another study. The final study included in this review combined yoga with counselling and an interactive question and answer session.The relative contribution of yoga was not clearly outlined in these studies. We found these studies by electronic searching of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register in March 2017. All participants continued to receive their prescribed antipsychotic treatment during their trial. Key results Many important outcomes were not addressed by the studies in this review, including mental, physical and social functioning, adverse effects and economic considerations. There may have been some small changes in quality of life in favour of the yoga package but overall there was not enough good‐quality evidence in this review to make any robust claims that yoga as a package of care should be prescribed as an add‐on to standard care for schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and weak. The number of included studies was small, and only short‐term follow‐up for two outcomes were reported. Schizophrenia often is a long‐term illness and more, larger, and long‐term trials that focus on important outcomes are necessary.","2017","2019-10-02 22:49:58","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Broderick17","","","","Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *Yoga; Quality of Life; Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data]; Combined Modality Therapy; Schizophrenia [*therapy]; Standard of Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. Objectives To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. Main results We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. Authors' conclusions The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases. Plain language summary Psychological therapies versus medication for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults Why is this review important? Panic disorder is common and harmful to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and medication (usually antidepressants or benzodiazepines) are effective against panic disorder. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the superiority and acceptability of these two forms of treatment, and such a review is necessary to improve treatment planning for this disorder. Who will be interested in this review? Adult patients, professionals working in mental health services, and general practitioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? The present review aims to answer the following questions: • Are psychological therapies more effective than antidepressants or benzodiazepines? • Are psychological therapies more acceptable than antidepressants or benzodiazepines? Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases to find all trials published between 1950 and September 2015 comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants or benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. To be included in the review, the studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the review. We rated the overall quality of the evidence from these studies as very low to moderate. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The superiority or inferiority of psychological therapies over drugs remains unclear with regard to treatment effectiveness and acceptability. None of the studies reported information regarding long‐term effectiveness and quality of life. What should happen next? The review authors recommend that future research should use less biased psychological therapies, evaluate long‐term outcomes, and report information related to the risk of study bias.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:57","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Imai16","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data]; Agoraphobia [complications; Antidepressive Agents [*therapeutic use]; Benzodiazepines [*therapeutic use]; Panic Disorder [complications; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Remission Induction; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors [*therapeutic use]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its prevalence is increasing in line with many chronic disorders such as diabetes. All treatments have limited effectiveness. Given the evidence regarding psychological treatment for distress and disability in people with various chronic pain conditions, we were interested to investigate whether psychological treatments have any effects for those with chronic neuropathic pain. Objectives To assess the effects of psychological treatments on pain experience, disability, mood, and health‐care use in adults with chronic neuropathic pain. Search methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any language in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, from database inception to March 2015. Selection criteria Full publications of RCTs on psychological interventions for neuropathic pain. Trials had to have lasted at least three months, had at least 20 participants in each arm at the end of treatment, and compared a psychological intervention with any active or inactive intervention. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Two small studies (enrolling a total of 105 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One was a standard cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) programme for 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury, followed up for three months, and compared with a waiting list. The other was weekly group psychotherapy for 44 people with burning mouth syndrome, compared with a daily placebo tablet. The overall risk of bias was high in both trials. The CBT study assessed participants for pain, disability, mood, and quality of life, with improvement in treatment and control groups. However, there was no more improvement in the treatment group than in the control for any outcome, either post‐treatment or at follow‐up. The group psychotherapy study only assessed pain, classifying participants by pain severity. There is a lack of evidence on the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for people with neuropathic pain. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two available studies show no benefit of treatment over either waiting list or placebo control groups. Plain language summary Psychological treatments for chronic pain involving damage or disease to nerves responsible for pain Many people experience pain from an injury or disease that goes away within three months, but for some people the pain continues. When the pain involves changes to nerves we call the pain 'neuropathic'. Although the condition is increasingly common, the treatments we have help only a few people. Following unsuccessful surgical or pharmacological treatment, people with chronic pain may be offered psychologically‐based rehabilitation to improve their quality of life. While we know that this can help people with other types of chronic pain, this treatment for neuropathic pain alone has received less research attention. In this review, we were interested in finding out whether psychological treatments improve pain, distress, and disability in people with chronic neuropathic pain. We searched the academic literature to March 2015 and identified two randomised controlled trials (the gold standard design for clinical trials) on psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two studies included 105 participants: one trial of 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury and the other of 44 people with burning mouth syndrome. Our confidence in the results of the individual trials was limited by several potential biases in how they were conducted. We were not able to analyse the results of the two trials together because the experiences of people with spinal cord injury or burning mouth are too different from each other. On their own, the trials were too small for us to undertake any statistical analysis. However, neither trial found any clear benefit of treatment. We conclude that there is currently no evidence that will help practitioners and patients to decide whether to use these treatments. We discuss what studies are needed.","2015","2019-10-02 22:49:57","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Eccleston15","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Group; *Psychotherapy; Chronic Pain [*therapy]; Neuralgia [*therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We defined aquatic training as exercising in a pool while standing at waist, chest, or shoulder depth. This review is part of the update of the 'Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome' review first published in 2002, and previously updated in 2007. Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of aquatic exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2 (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, Dissertation Abstracts, WHO international Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and AMED, as well as other sources (i.e., reference lists from key journals, identified articles, meta‐analyses, and reviews of all types of treatment for fibromyalgia) from inception to October 2013. Using Cochrane methods, we screened citations, abstracts, and full‐text articles. Subsequently, we identified aquatic exercise training studies. Selection criteria Selection criteria were: a) full‐text publication of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in adults diagnosed with fibromyalgia based on published criteria, and b) between‐group data for an aquatic intervention and a control or other intervention. We excluded studies if exercise in water was less than 50% of the full intervention. Data collection and analysis We independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data (24 outcomes), of which we designated seven as major outcomes: multidimensional function, self reported physical function, pain, stiffness, muscle strength, submaximal cardiorespiratory function, withdrawal rates and adverse effects. We resolved discordance through discussion. We evaluated interventions using mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Where two or more studies provided data for an outcome, we carried out meta‐analysis. In addition, we set and used a 15% threshold for calculation of clinically relevant differences. Main results We included 16 aquatic exercise training studies (N = 881; 866 women and 15 men). Nine studies compared aquatic exercise to control, five studies compared aquatic to land‐based exercise, and two compared aquatic exercise to a different aquatic exercise program. We rated the risk of bias related to random sequence generation (selection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias), and other bias as low. We rated blinding of participants and personnel (selection and performance bias) and allocation concealment (selection bias) as low risk and unclear. The assessment of the evidence showed limitations related to imprecision, high statistical heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals. Aquatic versus control We found statistically significant improvements (P value ¡ 0.05) in all of the major outcomes. Based on a 100‐point scale, multidimensional function improved by six units (MD ‐5.97, 95% CI ‐9.06 to ‐2.88; number needed to treat (NNT) 5, 95% CI 3 to 9), self reported physical function by four units (MD ‐4.35, 95% CI ‐7.77 to ‐0.94; NNT 6, 95% CI 3 to 22), pain by seven units (MD ‐6.59, 95% CI ‐10.71 to ‐2.48; NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 8), and stiffness by 18 units (MD ‐18.34, 95% CI ‐35.75 to ‐0.93; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 24) more in the aquatic than the control groups. The SMD for muscle strength as measured by knee extension and hand grip was 0.63 standard deviations higher compared to the control group (SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.05; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 12) and cardiovascular submaximal function improved by 37 meters on six‐minute walk test (95% CI 4.14 to 69.92). Only two major outcomes, stiffness and muscle strength, met the 15% threshold for clinical relevance (improved by 27% and 37% respectively). Withdrawals were similar in the aquatic and control groups and adverse effects were poorly reported, with no serious adverse effects reported. Aquatic versus land‐based There were no statistically significant differences between interventions for multidimensional function, self reported physical function, pain or stiffness: 0.91 units (95% CI ‐4.01 to 5.83), ‐5.85 units (95% CI ‐12.33 to 0.63), ‐0.75 units (95% CI ‐10.72 to 9.23), and two units (95% CI ‐8.88 to 1.28) respectively (all based on a 100‐point scale), or in submaximal cardiorespiratory function (three seconds on a 100‐meter walk test, 95% CI ‐1.77 to 7.77). We found a statistically significant difference between interventions for strength, favoring land–based training (2.40 kilo pascals grip strength, 95% CI 4.52 to 0.28). None of the outcomes in the aquatic versus land comparison reached clinically relevant differences of 15%. Withdrawals were similar in the aquatic and land groups and adverse effects were poorly reported, with no serious adverse effects in either group. Aquatic versus aquatic (Ai Chi versus stretching in the water, exercise in pool water versus exercise in sea water) Among the major outcomes the only statistically significant difference between interventions was for stiffness, favoring Ai Chi (1.00 on a 100‐point scale, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69). Authors' conclusions Low to moderate quality evidence relative to control suggests that aquatic training is beneficial for improving wellness, symptoms, and fitness in adults with fibromyalgia. Very low to low quality evidence suggests that there are benefits of aquatic and land‐based exercise, except in muscle strength (very low quality evidence favoring land). No serious adverse effects were reported. Plain language summary Aquatic exercise training for fibromyalgia Research question We reviewed studies on the effects of aquatic exercise training for people with fibromyalgia on wellness, symptoms, fitness, and adverse effects. Background: what is fibromyalgia and what is aquatic training? People with fibromyalgia have persistent, widespread body pain and often experience symptoms such as fatigue, stiffness, depression, and difficulty sleeping. Aquatic training is exercising in a pool while standing at waist, chest, or shoulder depth. This review examined the effects of supervised group aquatic training programs (led by an instructor). Study characteristics We searched the literature up to October 2013 and found 16 studies with 866 women and 15 men with fibromyalgia; 439 were assigned to aquatic training programs. Nine studies compared aquatic exercise to no exercise; five studies compared aquatic exercise to land‐based exercise, and two studies compared aquatic training to a different aquatic training. Key results: for those who took part in aquatic exercise training compared to people who did not exercise Overall well‐being (multidimensional function) on a scale of 0 to 100 units Those who did aquatic exercise rated their overall well‐being six units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Physical function (ability to do normal activities) on a scale of 0 to 100 units Those who did aquatic exercise rated their ability to function four units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 units Those who did aquatic exercise rated their pain seven units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Stiffness on a scale of 0 to 100 units Those who did aquatic exercise rated their stiffness 18 units better at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Muscle strength People who did aquatic training improved their muscle strength by 37% more than those who did not do aquatic training. Cardiovascular fitness estimated by meters walked in six minutes Those who did aquatic exercise walked 37 meters further at the end of the study than those who did not exercise. Dropping out of the studies Two more participants out of 100 in the aquatic training groups dropped out of the studies (15 aquatic exercisers dropped out while 13 non‐exercisers dropped out). Quality of evidence ‐ aquatic versus control Further research on overall well being and ability to function is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and may change the results. Further research on pain, stiffness, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and is likely to change the results. Key results: for those who did aquatic training compared to people who did land‐based exercise People who did both programs had similar results for overall well‐being, physical function, pain, and stiffness. However, people who exercise on land improved their muscle strength by 9% more than those who did aquatic training. About the same number of people from both groups dropped out. Quality of evidence ‐ aquatic versus land‐based As so few studies have been done so far, we are very uncertain about the results. Key results: for those who did one kind of aquatic training compared to a different kind of aquatic training There were two studies in this comparison: one compared Ai Chi (Tai Chi in the water) to stretching in the water, and the other compared aquatic training in a pool to aquatic training in sea water. The only important difference found was for stiffness, favoring the Ai Chi aquatic training. Quality of evidence ‐ aquatic versus aquatic programs As so few studies have been done so far, further research is likely to change this result.","2014","2019-10-02 22:49:57","2020-04-18 06:33:53","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Fibromyalgia [*therapy]; *methods]; Exercise Therapy [adverse effects; Hydrotherapy [adverse effects; Muscle Strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Psychological interventions are largely concerned with adherence to treatment, emotional and social adaptation and health‐related quality of life. We are unaware of any relevant systematic reviews. Objectives To determine whether psychological interventions for people with cystic fibrosis provide significant psychosocial and physical benefits in addition to standard medical care. Search methods Studies were identified from two Cochrane trials registers (Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group; Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group), Ovid MEDLINE and PsychINFO; unpublished trials were located through professional networks and Listserves. Most recent search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's register: 19 December 2013. Most recent search of the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's register: 12 November 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies of a broad range of psychological interventions evaluating subjective and objective health outcomes, such as quality of life or pulmonary function, in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their immediate family. We were interested in psychological interventions, including psychological methods within the scope of psychotherapeutic or psychosomatic mechanism of action (e.g. cognitive behavioural, cognitive, family systems or systemic, psycho‐dynamic, or other, e.g. supportive, relaxation, or biofeedback), which were aimed at improving psychological and psychosocial outcomes (e.g. quality of life, levels of stress or distress, psychopathology, etc.), adaptation to disease management and physiological outcomes. Data collection and analysis Three authors were involved in selecting the eligible studies and two of these authors assessed their risk of bias. Main results The review includes 16 studies (eight new studies included in this update) representing data from 556 participants. Studies are diverse in their design and their methods. They cover interventions with generic approaches, as well as interventions developed specifically to target disease‐specific symptoms and problems in people with cystic fibrosis. These include cognitive behavioural interventions to improve adherence to nutrition or psychosocial adjustment, cognitive interventions to improve adherence or those associated with decision making in lung transplantation, a community‐based support intervention and other interventions, such as self‐hypnosis, respiratory muscle biofeedback, music therapy, dance and movement therapy, and a tele‐medicine intervention to support patients awaiting transplantation. A substantial proportion of outcomes relate to adherence, changes in physical status or other specific treatment concerns during the chronic phase of the disease. There is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting nutrition and growth in children (4 to 12 years) with cystic fibrosis are effective in the short term. Evidence was found that providing a structured decision‐making tool for patients considering lung transplantation improves patients' knowledge of and expectations about the transplant, and reduces decisional conflict in the short term. One study about training in biofeedback‐assisted breathing demonstrated some evidence that it improved some lung function measurements. Currently there is insufficient evidence for interventions aimed at other aspects of the disease process. Authors' conclusions Currently, insufficient evidence exists on psychological interventions or approaches to support people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers, although some of the studies were promising. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, more of each type of intervention are needed to support preliminary evidence. Multicentre studies, with consequent funding implications, are needed to increase the sample size of these studies and enhance the statistical power and precision to detect important findings. In addition, multicentre studies could improve the generalisation of results by minimizing centre or therapist effects. Psychological interventions should be targeted to illness‐specific symptoms or behaviours to demonstrate efficacy. Plain language summary Psychological treatments to help individuals with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers manage the disease Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that damages many of the body's organs and can shorten a person's life span. The disease is progressive, stressful to manage, and needs complex and time‐consuming treatments, leaving patients and caregivers stressed due to the challenges of the treatment. Thus, individuals with cystic fibrosis and their family members often need help to cope better and to deal with their thoughts and feelings. They also need assistance in managing the demands of the prescribed treatment schedules. In addition, infection control guidelines recommend the isolation of people with cystic fibrosis from others with the same disease, leading to a lack of peer support and potential social isolation. We looked for studies of psychological treatments in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their families which aimed to reduce anxiety and depression, to improve adjustment, quality of life, and even medical outcomes, as well as knowledge, skills, and decisions regarding care. The review includes 16 studies with a total of 556 participants. Even though there many different psychological interventions, only a few have been evaluated for individuals with CF and their families. Due to the lack of high quality studies, it is not possible to currently show which psychological treatments are most helpful to those with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Five out of the 16 studies we found evaluated behavioural interventions to improve dietary intake. We found that in children aged 4 to 12 years receiving a nutritional intervention plus behavioural management training, consumed about 276 per day more than children just receiving the nutritional intervention. We also found that a structured decision‐making tool for adults considering lung transplantation improved their knowledge, assisted in setting realistic expectations, and reduced indecision. In summary, there is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting specific illness‐related symptoms and behaviours can work. More studies on psychological interventions with more people are urgently needed. There are several ongoing randomised controlled studies aimed at improving adherence to prescribed treatments, but final results are not yet available. We recommend multicentre studies to provide evidence for which interventions are most effective for the key issues faced by people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.","2014","2019-10-02 22:49:56","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Goldbeck03","","","","Adult; Humans; Child; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; therapy]; Caregivers [*psychology]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Cystic Fibrosis [*psychology; Diet [psychology]; Family; Family Therapy [methods]; Patient Compliance [psychology]; Respiratory Therapy [psychology]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is an update of a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self‐harm. Objectives To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, in adults following SH. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative treatments in adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. Data collection and analysis We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. Main results We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. Eighteen trials investigated cognitive‐behavioural‐based psychotherapy (CBT‐based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive‐behavioural, problem‐solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion‐regulation group‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality. There was a significant treatment effect for CBT‐based psychotherapy compared to TAU at final follow‐up in terms of fewer participants repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 2665; GRADE: low quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH (mean difference (MD) ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 0.26; k = 6; N = 594; GRADE: low quality). For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU: group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; GRADE: low quality), mentalisation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow‐up (MD ‐18.82, 95% CI ‐36.68 to ‐0.95; k = 3; N = 292; GRADE: low quality) but not in the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; N = 247; GRADE: low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological therapy, DBT‐oriented therapy was also associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition of SH at final follow‐up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k = 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However, neither DBT vs 'treatment by expert' (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k = 1; N = 97; GRADE: very low quality) nor prolonged exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k = 1; N = 18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH. Case management was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate quality). Continuity of care by the same therapist vs a different therapist was also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.10; k = 1; N = 136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer participants repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.02; k = 1; N = 391; GRADE: low quality), mixed multimodal interventions (comprising psychological therapy and remote contact‐based interventions) (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k = 4; N = 3277; GRADE: very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.14; k = 2; N = 1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner's letter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; k = 3; N = 840; GRADE: very low quality), and mobile telephone‐based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero cell counts; GRADE: low quality). None of the following mixed interventions were associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of psychological therapy: interpersonal problem‐solving skills training, behaviour therapy, home‐based problem‐solving therapy, long‐term psychotherapy; or to TAU: provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive outpatient treatment. We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported. Authors' conclusions CBT‐based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for self‐harm in adults Why is this review important? Self harm (SH), which includes non‐fatal intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is linked to risk of future suicide. It is distressing for both patients and their families and friends, and places large demands on clinical services. It is therefore important to assess the evidence on treatments for SH patients. Who will be interested in this review? Clinicians working with people who engage in SH, policy makers, people who themselves have engaged in SH or may be at risk of doing so, and their families and relatives. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 1999, which found little evidence of beneficial effects of psychosocial treatments on repetition of SH. This update aims to further evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial treatments for patients with SH with a broader range of outcomes. Which studies were included in the review? To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for adults who had recently engaged in SH. We searched electronic databases to find all such trials published up until 29 April 2015, and found 55 that met our inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There have now been a number of investigations of psychosocial treatments for SH in adults, with greater representation in recent years of low‐ and middle‐income countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Some moderate quality evidence shows that cognitive‐behavioural‐based (CBT‐based) psychotherapy (a psychotherapy intended to change unhelpful thinking, emotions and behaviour) may help prevent repetition of SH, although it did not reduce overall frequency of SH. There were encouraging results (from small trials of moderate to very low quality) for other interventions aimed at reducing the frequency of SH in people with probable personality disorder, including group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy, mentalisation (a psychosocial therapy intended to increase a person’s understanding of their own and others' mental state), and dialectical behaviour therapies (DBT; psychosocial therapies intended to assist with identification of triggers that lead to reactive behaviours and to provide individuals with emotional coping skills to avoid these reactions). Whilst DBT was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at final follow‐up as compared to usual treatment, there was evidence of low quality suggesting a reduction in frequency of SH. There was no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of prolonged exposure to DBT, case management, approaches to improve treatment adherence, mixed multimodal interventions (comprising both psychological therapy and remote contact‐based interventions), remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, and telephone contact), interpersonal problem‐solving skills training, behaviour therapy, provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, home‐based problem‐solving therapy, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, intensive outpatient treatment, or long‐term psychotherapy. We had only limited evidence from a subset of the studies relating to whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. The trials did not report on side effects other than suicidal behaviour. What should happen next? The promising results for CBT‐based psychological therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy warrant further investigation to understand which patients benefit from these types of interventions. There were only a few, generally small trials on most other types of psychosocial therapies, providing little evidence of beneficial effects; however, these cannot be ruled out. There is a need for more information about whether psychosocial interventions might work differently between men and women.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:58","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Hawton16","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Problem Solving; Depression [therapy]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [methods]; Personality Disorders [therapy]; Self‐Injurious Behavior [psychology; Suicidal Ideation; Theory of Mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. A previous Cochrane meta‐analysis suggested that psychological therapy (either alone or combined with pharmacotherapy) can be chosen as a first‐line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However, it is not yet clear whether certain psychological therapies can be considered superior to others. In order to answer this question, in this review we performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA), in which we compared eight different forms of psychological therapy and three forms of a control condition. Objectives To assess the comparative efficacy and acceptability of different psychological therapies and different control conditions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. Search methods We conducted the main searches in the CCDANCTR electronic databases (studies and references registers), all years to 16 March 2015. We conducted complementary searches in PubMed and trials registries. Supplementary searches included reference lists of included studies, citation indexes, personal communication to the authors of all included studies and grey literature searches in OpenSIGLE. We applied no restrictions on date, language or publication status. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on adults with a formal diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We considered the following psychological therapies: psychoeducation (PE), supportive psychotherapy (SP), physiological therapies (PT), behaviour therapy (BT), cognitive therapy (CT), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT (3W) and psychodynamic therapies (PD). We included both individual and group formats. Therapies had to be administered face‐to‐face. The comparator interventions considered for this review were: no treatment (NT), wait list (WL) and attention/psychological placebo (APP). For this review we considered four short‐term (ST) outcomes (ST‐remission, ST‐response, ST‐dropouts, ST‐improvement on a continuous scale) and one long‐term (LT) outcome (LT‐remission/response). Data collection and analysis As a first step, we conducted a systematic search of all relevant papers according to the inclusion criteria. For each outcome, we then constructed a treatment network in order to clarify the extent to which each type of therapy and each comparison had been investigated in the available literature. Then, for each available comparison, we conducted a random‐effects meta‐analysis. Subsequently, we performed a network meta‐analysis in order to synthesise the available direct evidence with indirect evidence, and to obtain an overall effect size estimate for each possible pair of therapies in the network. Finally, we calculated a probabilistic ranking of the different psychological therapies and control conditions for each outcome. Main results We identified 1432 references; after screening, we included 60 studies in the final qualitative analyses. Among these, 54 (including 3021 patients) were also included in the quantitative analyses. With respect to the analyses for the first of our primary outcomes, (short‐term remission), the most studied of the included psychological therapies was CBT (32 studies), followed by BT (12 studies), PT (10 studies), CT (three studies), SP (three studies) and PD (two studies). The quality of the evidence for the entire network was found to be low for all outcomes. The quality of the evidence for CBT vs NT, CBT vs SP and CBT vs PD was low to very low, depending on the outcome. The majority of the included studies were at unclear risk of bias with regard to the randomisation process. We found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and detection bias. We also found selective outcome reporting bias to be present and we strongly suspected publication bias. Finally, we found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of researcher allegiance bias. Overall the networks appeared to be well connected, but were generally underpowered to detect any important disagreement between direct and indirect evidence. The results showed the superiority of psychological therapies over the WL condition, although this finding was amplified by evident small study effects (SSE). The NMAs for ST‐remission, ST‐response and ST‐improvement on a continuous scale showed well‐replicated evidence in favour of CBT, as well as some sparse but relevant evidence in favour of PD and SP, over other therapies. In terms of ST‐dropouts, PD and 3W showed better tolerability over other psychological therapies in the short term. In the long term, CBT and PD showed the highest level of remission/response, suggesting that the effects of these two treatments may be more stable with respect to other psychological therapies. However, all the mentioned differences among active treatments must be interpreted while taking into account that in most cases the effect sizes were small and/or results were imprecise. Authors' conclusions There is no high‐quality, unequivocal evidence to support one psychological therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, the results show that CBT ‐ the most extensively studied among the included psychological therapies ‐ was often superior to other therapies, although the effect size was small and the level of precision was often insufficient or clinically irrelevant. In the only two studies available that explored PD, this treatment showed promising results, although further research is needed in order to better explore the relative efficacy of PD with respect to CBT. Furthermore, PD appeared to be the best tolerated (in terms of ST‐dropouts) among psychological treatments. Unexpectedly, we found some evidence in support of the possible viability of non‐specific supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder; however, the results concerning SP should be interpreted cautiously because of the sparsity of evidence regarding this treatment and, as in the case of PD, further research is needed to explore this issue. Behaviour therapy did not appear to be a valid alternative to CBT as a first‐line treatment for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia Why is this review important? Many people suffer from panic disorder. Panic disorder can occur on its own or with agoraphobia. People with panic disorder experience recurring panic attacks. During a panic attack people feel the sudden onset of intense fear alongside a series of bodily symptoms such as a racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. People with agoraphobia feel an intense fear of developing a panic attack in situations where escape might be difficult or embarrassing. This fear often leads to the avoidance of such situations. There are many different types of talking therapies that are used to treat panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However it is not clear whether certain talking therapies are more effective than others at treating panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. In this review we compared the effectiveness of different types of talking therapy. Who will be interested in this review? People with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Friends and family of people with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. General practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists. Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? Are any of the included psychological therapies more effective and better tolerated than others in the rapid reduction of panic/agoraphobia symptoms? Can any of the included psychological therapies guarantee better results one year after termination? Which studies were included in the review? We searched medical databases up to 16 March 2015 to find all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) of talking therapies in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. To be included in the review studies had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We included 60 studies in the review. Fifty‐four of the included studies (involving 3021 participants) were used in numerical analyses. The review authors rated the overall quality of the studies as low to very low. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The results of the review show that in general talking therapies are more effective than no treatment. There was no strong evidence to support one talking therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, there was some low‐quality evidence in favour of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy over other talking therapies for short‐term remission and short‐term reduction in symptoms. The results concerning supportive psychotherapy should, however, be treated with caution because of the small amount of evidence available about this treatment. On the other hand, beyond the evidence regarding its efficacy, psychodynamic therapy also showed promising results in terms of tolerability: as a way of assessing how well people tolerated the talking therapies, we assessed short‐term dropout rates. We found that there were fewer dropouts in psychodynamic therapy and third‐wave CBT, suggesting that people tolerate these therapies better than other therapies. What should happen next? More high‐quality research is needed to be able to fully compare the effectiveness of different talking therapies. In particular, more new studies are needed that compare the specific talking therapies CBT, psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:58","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Pompoli16","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Agoraphobia [psychology; Panic Disorder [psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its complex and diverse effects interact with ethnicity, gender, and refugee experience. Health and welfare agencies offer varied rehabilitation services, from conventional mental health treatment to eclectic or needs‐based interventions. This review is needed because relatively little outcome research has been done in this field, and no previous systematic review has been conducted. Resources are scarce, and the challenges of providing services can be considerable. Objectives To assess beneficial and adverse effects of psychological, social and welfare interventions for torture survivors, and to compare these effects with those reported by active and inactive controls. Search methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through a search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Specialised Register (CCDANCTR), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), the Open System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and Published International Literature On Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) all years to 11 April 2013; searches of Cochrane resources, international trial registries and the main biomedical databases were updated on 20 June 2014. We also searched the Online Library of Dignity (Danish Institute against Torture), reference lists of reviews and included studies and the most frequently cited journals, up to April 2013 but not repeated for 2014. Investigators were contacted to provide updates or details as necessary. Selection criteria Full publications of RCTs or quasi‐RCTs of psychological, social or welfare interventions for survivors of torture against any active or inactive comparison condition. Data collection and analysis We included all major sources of grey literature in our search and used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration for collecting data, evaluating risk of bias and using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence. Main results Nine RCTs were included in this review. All were of psychological interventions; none provided social or welfare interventions. The nine trials provided data for 507 adults; none involved children or adolescents. Eight of the nine studies described individual treatment, and one discussed group treatment. Six trials were conducted in Europe, and three in different African countries. Most people were refugees in their thirties and forties; most met the criteria for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the outset. Four trials used narrative exposure therapy (NET), one cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and the other four used mixed methods for trauma symptoms, one of which included reconciliation methods. Five interventions were compared with active controls, such as psychoeducation; four used treatment as usual or waiting list/no treatment; we analysed all control conditions together. Duration of therapy varied from one hour to longer than 20 hours with a median of around 12 to 15 hours. All trials reported effects on distress and on PTSD, and two reported on quality of life. Five studies followed up participants for at least six months. No immediate benefits of psychological therapy were noted in comparison with controls in terms of our primary outcome of distress (usually depression), nor for PTSD symptoms, PTSD caseness, or quality of life. At six‐month follow‐up, three NET and one CBT study (86 participants) showed moderate effect sizes for intervention over control in reduction of distress (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.07 to ‐0.19) and of PTSD symptoms (SMD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.07). However, the quality of evidence was very low, and risk of bias resulted from researcher/therapist allegiance to treatment methods, effects of uncertain asylum status of some people and real‐time non‐standardised translation of assessment measures. No measures of adverse events were described, nor of participation, social functioning, quantity of social or family relationships, proxy measures by third parties or satisfaction with treatment. Too few studies were identified for review authors to attempt sensitivity analyses. Authors' conclusions Very low‐quality evidence suggests no differences between psychological therapies and controls in terms of immediate effects on post‐traumatic symptoms, distress or quality of life; however, NET and CBT were found to confer moderate benefits in reducing distress and PTSD symptoms over the medium term (six months after treatment). Evidence was of very low quality, mainly because non‐standardised assessment methods using interpreters were applied, and sample sizes were very small. Most eligible trials also revealed medium to high risk of bias. Further, attention to the cultural appropriateness of interventions or to their psychometric qualities was inadequate, and assessment measures used were unsuitable. As such, these findings should be interpreted with caution. No data were available on whether symptom reduction enabled improvements in quality of life, participation in community life, or in social and family relationships in the medium term. Details of adverse events and treatment satisfaction were not available immediately after treatment nor in the medium term. Future research should aim to address these gaps in the evidence and should include larger sample sizes when possible. Problems of torture survivors need to be defined far more broadly than by PTSD symptoms, and recognition given to the contextual influences of being a torture survivor, including as an asylum seeker or refugee, on psychological and social health. Plain language summary Psychological, social and welfare interventions for the psychological health and well‐being of torture survivors Why is this review important? Torture is a widespread problem that can cause lasting and severe physical, psychological, social and welfare problems for survivors. Treatment is offered by various agencies: some provide support in diverse settings from refugee camps to high‐income countries; others support survivors in countries where current or recent repression or armed conflict is known. Resources for these services are scarce, so it is important that they are used to greatest effect to improve the well‐being of torture survivors. Who will be interested in this review? Agencies providing health and welfare services for torture survivors; organisations that fund these agencies; torture survivors and those close to them. What questions does this review aim to answer? What intervention improves well‐being among torture survivors with psychological, social and welfare problems? Which studies were included in the review? We searched the academic literature and the non‐academic literature such as reports of non‐governmental agencies providing services to April 2013, and again to June 2014. Studies had to describe a randomised controlled trial of intervention for psychological, social or welfare problems among torture survivors—adults or children. We found nine trials with 507 adults that examined varied psychological interventions compared with no treatment or a credible alternative treatment. Six trials were conducted at treatment centres in Europe, and three in African refugee settings; all focused on post‐traumatic stress and were of low to moderate quality. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Very low‐quality evidence suggests no differences between psychological therapies and controls in terms of an immediate effect on post‐traumatic symptoms, distress or quality of life. However, at six‐month follow‐up, four studies (86 people) showed moderate benefit in terms of post‐traumatic stress and distress. Three trials were of narrative exposure therapy, and one of cognitive‐behavioural therapy, but we have little confidence in these results because the evidence was of very low quality and the trials included very small numbers of people. No studies assessed worsening of problems, nor changes in family and social relationships or community participation, with or without improvement in symptoms. What should happen next? Studies need to identify broader aims for intervention and should continue to test a range of interventions consistent with the breadth of problems of torture survivors. Investigators also need to assess changes with validity across cultures and languages.","2014","2019-10-02 22:49:57","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Patel14","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stress; therapy]; Psychotherapy; *Mental Health; Group; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [methods]; Human Rights [education]; Narrative Therapy [methods]; Post‐Traumatic [psychology; Psychological; Psychological [psychology; Quality of Life [*psychology]; Refugees [psychology]; Resilience; Stress Disorders; Torture [*psychology]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depression is highly debilitating, affecting psychosocial, family and academic functioning. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies and antidepressant medication, alone and in combination, for the treatment of depressive disorder in children and adolescents. We have examined clinical outcomes including remission, clinician and self reported depression measures, and suicide‐related outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 11 June 2014. The register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Selection criteria RCTs were eligible for inclusion if they compared i) any psychological therapy with any antidepressant medication, or ii) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a psychological therapy alone, or an antidepressant medication alone, or iii) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a placebo or ' treatment as usual', or (iv) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a psychological therapy or antidepressant medication plus a placebo. We included studies if they involved participants aged between 6 and 18 years, diagnosed by a clinician as having Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies. We applied a random‐effects meta‐analysis, using the odds ratio (OR) to describe dichotomous outcomes, mean difference (MD) to describe continuous outcomes when the same measures were used, and standard mean difference (SMD) when outcomes were measured on different scales. Main results We included eleven studies, involving 1307 participants in this review. We also identified one ongoing study, and two additional ongoing studies that may be eligible for inclusion. Studies recruited participants with different severities of disorder and with a variety of comorbid disorders, including anxiety and substance use disorder, therefore limiting the comparability of the results. Regarding the risk of bias in studies, just under half the studies had adequate allocation concealment (there was insufficient information to determine allocation concealment in the remainder), outcome assessors were blind to the participants' intervention in six studies, and in general, studies reported on incomplete data analysis methods, mainly using intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses. For the majority of outcomes there were no statistically significant differences between the interventions compared. There was limited evidence (based on two studies involving 220 participants) that antidepressant medication was more effective than psychotherapy on measures of clinician defined remission immediately post‐intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.98), with 67.8% of participants in the medication group and 53.7% in the psychotherapy group rated as being in remission. There was limited evidence (based on three studies involving 378 participants) that combination therapy was more effective than antidepressant medication alone in achieving higher remission from a depressive episode immediately post‐intervention (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.47), with 65.9% of participants treated with combination therapy and 57.8% of participants treated with medication, rated as being in remission. There was no evidence to suggest that combination therapy was more effective than psychological therapy alone, based on clinician rated remission immediately post‐intervention (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.68). Suicide‐related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported in various ways across studies and could not be combined in meta‐analyses. However, some trials measured suicidal ideation using standardised assessment tools suitable for meta‐analysis. In one study involving 188 participants, rates of suicidal ideation were significantly higher in the antidepressant medication group (18.6%) compared with the psychological therapy group (5.4%) (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.72) and this effect appeared to remain at six to nine months (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98), with 13.6% of participants in the medication group and 3.9% of participants in the psychological therapy group reporting suicidal ideation. It was unclear what the effect of combination therapy was compared with either antidepressant medication alone or psychological therapy alone on rates of suicidal ideation. The impact of any of the assigned treatment packages on drop out was also mostly unclear across the various comparisons in the review. Limited data and conflicting results based on other outcome measures make it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of any specific intervention based on these outcomes. Authors' conclusions There is very limited evidence upon which to base conclusions about the relative effectiveness of psychological interventions, antidepressant medication and a combination of these interventions. On the basis of the available evidence, the effectiveness of these interventions for treating depressive disorders in children and adolescents cannot be established. Further appropriately powered RCTs are required. Plain language summary Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents, with suggested overall prevalence rates for adolescents (13 to 18 years) being 5.7% and for children (under 13 years) 2.8%. Common symptoms of depression in children and adolescents include low mood, a loss of interest in once enjoyed activities, difficulties with concentration and motivation, changes in appetite and sleep, irritability, physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach aches and in some cases thoughts of suicide. If left untreated, depressive disorders in the younger years are likely to continue into adulthood, and can be increasingly difficult to treat as time goes on. Both psychological therapies and antidepressant medication can be used to treat depression in children and adolescents. Psychological therapies, sometimes called 'talking therapies', involve working with a qualified therapist to treat the depression. Psychological therapies in common use are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and psychodynamic therapy. There are many different types of antidepressant medication, all of which have been developed specifically to work on chemicals in the brain that are believed to be linked to depression. Research has been undertaken on psychological therapies and antidepressant medication, alone and in combination, to asses the effects of these interventions on depression in children and adolescents. In order to asses whether either intervention or a combination of both is most effective, we included studies that compared: (1) any psychological therapy with any antidepressant medication; (2) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with either psychotherapy alone or antidepressant medication alone; (3) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with a placebo or ' treatment as usual'; (4) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with either therapy plus a placebo. We included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1307 participants in this review. These trials made a variety of different comparisons and only a small number of trials contributed information about each of the comparisons made in the review. Although most analyses included more than one trial, the results of these trials sometimes differed considerably or were even contradictory. In terms of adverse effects of treatment, in one trial, rates of suicidal thoughts were higher in those taking antidepressant medication, compared with those delivered psychological therapy. Overall, it was not possible to draw robust conclusions from the meta‐analyses, nor to establish which intervention strategy was most effective. In summary, on the basis of the available evidence, we do not know whether psychological therapy, antidepressant medication or a combination of the two is most effective to treat depressive disorders in children and adolescents.","2014","2019-10-02 22:49:56","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Cox12","","","","Humans; Child; Adolescent; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Depressive Disorder; Major [*therapy]; Antidepressive Agents [*therapeutic use]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Suicidal Ideation; Anxiety [therapy]; Combined Modality Therapy [methods]; Substance‐Related Disorders [therapy]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of the current evidence was needed to assess the effects of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy on HRQoL outcomes, in order to inform future therapeutic recommendations and research designs. Objectives To assess the effects of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy on HRQoL outcomes. Search methods We searched the following databases on 20 September 2016, without language restrictions: Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov , WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) . We screened the references from included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted researchers in the field for unpublished studies. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs for this review. HRQoL was the main outcome measure. For the operational definition of 'psychological treatments', we included a broad range of treatments that used psychological or behavioral techniques designed to improve HRQoL, seizure frequency and severity, and psychiatric comorbidities for adults and children with epilepsy, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) or an active control group. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included 24 completed RCTs, with a total of 2439 participants. Eleven studies investigated psychological interventions, such as cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness‐based interventions. The remaining studies were classified as educational interventions (N = 7), self‐management interventions (N = 3), adherence interventions (N = 1), and mixed interventions (N = 2). Two studies investigated interventions for children and adolescents, and five studies investigated interventions for adolescents and adults. Based on satisfactory clinical and methodological homogeneity, we pooled data from six adult studies, two studies on adolescents and adults, and one on adolescents and young adults (468 participants) for HRQoL, measured with the Quality of Life in Epilepsy‐31 (QOLIE‐31). We found significant mean changes for the QOLIE‐31 total score and six subscales (emotional well‐being, energy and fatigue, overall QoL, seizure worry, medication effects, and cognitive functioning). The mean changes of the QOLIE‐31 total score (mean improvement of 5.68 points (95% CI 3.11 to 8.24; P ¡ 0.0001), and three subscales, emotional well‐being (mean improvement of 7.03 points (95% CI 2.51 to 11.54; P = 0.002); energy and Fatigue (mean improvement of 6.90 points (95% CI 3.49 to 10.31; P ¡ 0.0001); and overall QoL (mean improvement of 6.47 points (95% CI 2.68 to 10.25; P = 0.0008) exceeded the threshold of minimally important change (MIC), indicating a clinically meaningful post‐intervention improvement of QoL. We downgraded the quality of the evidence provided by the meta‐analysis because of serious risk of bias in some of the included studies. Consequentially, these results provided evidence of moderate quality that psychological treatments for adults with epilepsy may enhance overall QoL in people with epilepsy. Authors' conclusions Implications for practice: Psychological interventions and self‐management interventions improved QoL, and emotional well‐being, and reduced fatigue in adults and adolescents with epilepsy. Adjunctive use of psychological treatments for adults and adolescents with epilepsy may provide additional benefits to QoL in those who incorporate patient‐centered management. Implications for research: Authors should strictly adhere to the CONSORT guidelines to improve the quality of reporting on their interventions. A thorough description of the intervention protocol is necessary to ensure reproducibility. When researching psychological treatments for people with epilepsy, the use of Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventories (QOLIE‐31, QOLIE‐31‐P, and QOLIE‐89) would increase comparability. There is a critical gap in pediatric RCTs for psychological treatments, particularly those that use an epilepsy‐specific measure of HRQoL. Finally, in order to increase the overall quality of study designs, adequate randomization with allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment should be pursued when conducting RCTs. As attrition is often high in research that requires active participant participation, an intention‐to‐treat analysis should be carried out. Plain language summary Psychological Treatments for People with Epilepsy Background Epilepsy is defined as the chronic predisposition of the brain to have recurrent seizures. It has been recognised that individuals with epilepsy, especially those who continue to have seizures despite adequate medication (drug‐resistant epilepsy), are at increased risk of psychiatric disorders or psychological difficulties. Individuals with epilepsy often have lower quality of life (QoL) compared to those with other chronic diseases. Factors that have been shown to contribute to poor health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) include medical parameters (such as seizure frequency and severity and antiepileptic drug side effects) and complex psychological parameters (including depression and anxiety, fear of losing control, worries about seizure occurrence, and negative coping). While medical providers focus on minimizing seizures and side effects, a primary role that mental and behavioral health providers (i.e. psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers) can have with individuals with epilepsy is to optimize HRQoL by providing evidence‐based psychological treatments. Research Question This review aimed to assess the effects of psychological treatments on HRQoL for people with epilepsy. Characteristics of the Studies We included 24 studies that met the inclusion criteria (2439 participants). The majority of trials investigated psychological interventions, such as cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness‐based interventions. The remaining studies focused on education, self‐management, and drug adherence. Two studies investigated interventions for children and adolescents, and five studies investigated interventions for adolescents and adults. The evidence presented in this review is up to date to September 2016. Quality of the Studies We assessed variable quality in the design and reporting across studies. However, there were some quality issues with the majority of studies. Results Based on satisfactory comparability, we combined data from nine adult studies (468 participants) providing HRQoL outcomes in a meta‐analysis. These results provided moderate‐quality evidence that psychological treatments may enhance overall QoL and emotional well‐being, and reduce fatigue in adults and adolescents with epilepsy. Conclusions We found moderate‐quality evidence that psychological and self‐management interventions were beneficial for adults and adolescents with epilepsy, by improving overall quality of life and emotional well‐being and reducing fatigue. Adjunctive use of psychological treatments may provide additional benefits to QoL in adults with epilepsy who incorporate patient‐centered management. The uniform use of Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventories when researching psychological treatments for people with epilepsy, would increase comparability.","2017","2019-10-02 22:49:55","2020-04-18 08:14:42","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Michaelis17 tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Adult; Humans; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Energy Metabolism; Quality of Life; Bias; Epilepsy [*psychology; Fatigue [therapy]; Psychotherapy; #duplicate-citation-key","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Psychological and educational interventions are frequently offered to subfertile couples, but their effectiveness, both in improving mental health and pregnancy rates, is unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions for subfertile couples on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes. Search methods We searched (from inception to 2 April 2015) the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 2, 2015), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, DARE, Web of Science, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed, and ongoing trials registers. We handsearched reference lists and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised trials, and cross‐over trials (first phase) evaluating the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes in subfertile couples. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Our primary outcomes were psychological measures (anxiety and depression) and fertility rates (live birth or ongoing pregnancy). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. As we did not consider the included studies to be sufficiently similar to permit meaningful pooling, we summarised the results of the individual studies by presenting the median and interquartile range (IQR) of effects as well as the minimum and maximum values. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous variables and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes. Main results We included 39 studies involving 4925 participants undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to a number of factors, including nature and duration of interventions, participants, and comparator groups. As a result, we judged that pooling results would not result in a clinically meaningful estimate of a treatment effect. There were substantial methodological weaknesses in the studies, all of which were judged to be at high risk of bias for one or more quality assessment domains. There was concern about attrition bias (24 studies), performance bias for psychological outcomes (27 studies) and fertility outcomes (18 studies), and detection bias for psychological outcomes (26 studies). We therefore considered study‐specific estimates of intervention effects to be unreliable. Thirty‐three studies reported the outcome mental health. Only two studies reported the outcome live birth, and both of these had substantial attrition. One study reported ongoing pregnancy, again with substantial attrition. We have combined live birth and ongoing pregnancy in one outcome. Psychological outcomes Studies utilised a variety of measures of anxiety and depression. In all cases a low score denoted benefit from the intervention. SMDs for anxiety were as follows: psychological interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median (IQR) = ‐0.30 (‐0.84 to 0.00), minimum value ‐5.13; maximum value 0.84, 17 RCTs, 2042 participants; educational interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median = 0.03, minimum value ‐0.38; maximum value 0.23, 4 RCTs, 330 participants. SMDs for depression were as follows: psychological interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median (IQR) = ‐0.45 (‐0.68 to ‐0.08), minimum value ‐3.01; maximum value 1.23, 12 RCTs, 1160 participants; educational interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median = ‐0.33, minimum value ‐0.46; maximum value 0.17, 3 RCTs, 304 participants. Fertility outcomes When psychological interventions were compared with attentional control or usual care, ORs for live birth or ongoing pregnancy ranged from minimum value 1.13 to maximum value 10.05. No studies of educational interventions reported this outcome. Authors' conclusions The effects of psychological and educational interventions on mental health including distress, and live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates is uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. Existing trials of psychological and educational interventions for subfertility were generally poorly designed and executed, resulting in very serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency in study findings. There is a need for studies employing appropriate methodological techniques to investigate the benefits of these treatments for this population. In particular, attentional control groups should be employed, that is groups receiving a treatment that mimics the amount of time and attention received by the treatment group but is not thought to have a specific effect upon the participants, in order to distinguish between therapeutic and non‐specific effects of interventions. Where attrition cannot be minimised, appropriate statistical techniques for handling drop‐out must be applied. Failure to address these issues in study design has resulted in studies that do not provide a valid basis for answering questions about the effectiveness of these interventions. Plain language summary Psychological and educational interventions for subfertile men and women Background: Approximately one‐fifth of all subfertile couples seeking fertility treatment show clinically relevant levels of anxiety, depression, or distress. Psychological and educational interventions are frequently offered to subfertile couples, but their effectiveness, both in improving mental health and pregnancy rates, is unclear. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions for subfertile couples on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes. Study characteristics: We included 39 studies involving 4925 participants undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Studies varied widely with respect to a number of factors, including nature and duration of interventions, participants, and comparator groups. The evidence is current to April 2015. Key results: There were substantial methodological weaknesses in the studies, all of which were judged to be at high risk of bias for one or more quality assessment domains. We therefore determined that pooling results would not result in a clinically meaningful estimate of a treatment effect and that we could not present a pooled analysis in the 'Summary of findings' table. There was concern about bias because of differences in care and amount of attention given to participants for psychological outcomes (27 studies) and fertility outcomes (18 studies), the amount of withdrawal (24 studies), and the manner in which outcome measurements were taken (26 studies). We therefore considered the results from each study to be unreliable. Thirty‐three studies reported the outcome mental health. Only two studies reported the outcome live birth, and one study reported ongoing pregnancy; all of these studies had substantial attrition. It was not possible to answer the review question for any of the primary outcomes. Quality of the evidence: We judged the overall quality of the evidence to be very low, the main reasons being very serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency in study findings.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:55","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Verkuijlen16","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; *therapy]; Stress; Treatment Outcome; Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data]; Psychological [*therapy]; Anxiety [*therapy]; Assisted; Depression [*therapy]; Infertility [*psychology; Live Birth; Pregnancy Rate; Reproductive Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prevalence in the community of case level depression is around 15% and milder forms of depression are more common. It causes significant distress and disability. The number of people over the age of 60 years is expected to double by 2050 and so interventions for this often long‐term and recurrent condition are increasingly important. The causes of late‐life depression differ from depression in younger adults and so it is appropriate to study it separately. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2012. Objectives To examine the efficacy of antidepressants and psychological therapies in preventing the relapse and recurrence of depression in older people. Search methods We performed a search of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's specialised register (the CCMDCTR) to 13 July 2015. The CCMDCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also conducted a cited reference search on 13 July 2015 of the Web of Science for citations of primary reports of included studies. Selection criteria Both review authors independently selected studies. We included RCTs involving people aged 60 years and over successfully treated for an episode of depression and randomised to receive continuation and maintenance treatment with antidepressants, psychological therapies, or a combination. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome for benefit was recurrence rate of depression (reaching a cut‐off on any depression rating scale) at 12 months and the primary outcome for harm was drop‐outs at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included relapse/recurrence rates at other time points, global impression of change, social functioning, and deaths. We performed meta‐analysis using risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results This update identified no further trials. Seven studies from the previous review met the inclusion criteria (803 participants). Six compared antidepressant medication with placebo; two involved psychological therapies. There was marked heterogeneity between the studies. Comparing antidepressants with placebo on the primary outcome for benefit, there was a statistically significant difference favouring antidepressants in reducing recurrence compared with placebo at 12 months with a GRADE rating of low for quality of evidence (three RCTs, n = 247, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5). Comparing antidepressants with placebo on the primary outcome for harms, there was no difference in drop‐out rates at 12 months' follow‐up, with a GRADE rating of low. There was no significant difference between psychological treatment and antidepressant in recurrence rates at 12 months (one RCT, n = 53) or between combination treatment and antidepressant alone at 12 months. Authors' conclusions This updated Cochrane review supports the findings of the original 2012 review. The long‐term benefits and harm of continuing antidepressant medication in the prevention of recurrence of depression in older people are not clear and no firm treatment recommendations can be made on the basis of this review. Continuing antidepressant medication for 12 months appears to be helpful with no increased harms; however, this was based on only three small studies, relatively few participants, use of a range of antidepressant classes, and clinically heterogeneous populations. Comparisons at other time points did not reach statistical significance. Data on psychological therapies and combined treatments were too limited to draw any conclusions on benefits and harms. The quality of the evidence used in reaching these conclusions was low and the review does not, therefore, offer clear guidance to clinicians and patients on best practice and matching interventions to particular patient characteristics. Of note, we identified no new studies that evaluated pharmacological or psychological interventions in the continuation and maintenance treatment of depression in older people. We are aware of studies conducted since the previous review that included both older people and adults under the age of 65 years, but these fall outside of the remit of this review. We believe that there remains a need for studies solely recruiting older people, particularly the 'older old' with comorbid medical problems. However, these studies are likely to be challenging to conduct and may not, so far, have been prioritised by funders. Plain language summary Long‐term treatment for depression in older people This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2012. Why is this review important? Depression is a common problem among older people and causes considerable disability. Even after successful treatment, it frequently recurs. The causes of depression in older people are more diverse than in younger adults and, as the number of older people is steadily increasing, it is important to study the effects of treatments specifically in older adults. Treatments commonly used are antidepressant drugs and psychological treatments (talking treatments). Who will be interested in this review? ‐ People with depression, friends, families, and carers. ‐ General practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists. ‐ Professionals working in older‐adult mental health services. ‐ Professionals working in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services in the UK. What questions does this review aim to answer? In people aged 60 years and over who have recovered from depression while taking antidepressant medication: ‐ Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two more effective in preventing recurrence of depression than receiving placebo (a pretend treatment) or any of the other treatments? ‐ Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two more harmful than receiving placebo or any of the other treatments? Which studies does the review include? We searched medical databases to find all relevant studies completed up to 13 July 2015. The studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two, with placebo or the other treatments for preventing recurrence of depression in people aged 60 years and over. We included seven studies, involving 803 people. Six studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo. Only two of the studies involved psychological treatments. The studies varied in how they were conducted, numbers of participants, and types of participants. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Remaining on antidepressant medicines for one year appears to reduce the risk of depression returning from 61% to 42% but the benefits at other time intervals could not be determined. Antidepressant treatment appeared to be no more harmful than placebo as measured by number of participants dropping out of trials. The benefits of psychological therapies were not clear, due to the small number of studies. The quality of evidence was low. The majority of participants in the studies were women. Few were over 75 years of age. Most had received treatment for their original depressive illness as outpatients, indicating less severe depression. Antidepressant medicines used were both older type antidepressants (called tricyclics) and newer type (called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Psychological treatments were interpersonal therapy, which addresses obstacles in relationships, and cognitive behavioural therapy, which addresses inactivity and self‐defeating thought patterns. What should happen next? This review provides limited evidence that continuing antidepressant medication for one year can reduce the risk of depression recurring with no additional harm. However, it cannot be used to make firm recommendations due to the limited number and small size of studies involved. Limitations in the design and reporting of these studies may also make the results unrepresentative. Similarly, no firm conclusions can be drawn about psychological treatments or combinations of antidepressant and psychological treatments in preventing recurrence. Further, larger, trials are required to clarify any benefits of antidepressant and psychological treatments. These trials should include more people aged over 75, and people with other problems typical of people treated in routine clinical services, such long‐term physical illness and mild memory problems.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:55","2020-04-18 06:34:31","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Antidepressive Agents [*therapeutic use]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Combined Modality Therapy [methods]; Depression [*therapy]; Maintenance Chemotherapy [methods]; Secondary Prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mind‐body interventions incorporate strategies that are thought to improve psychological and physical well‐being, aim to allow patients to take an active role in their treatment, and promote people's ability to cope. Mind‐body interventions are widely used by people with fibromyalgia to help manage their symptoms and improve well‐being. Examples of mind‐body therapies include psychological therapies, biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation strategies. Objectives To review the benefits and harms of mind‐body therapies in comparison to standard care and attention placebo control groups for adults with fibromyalgia, post‐intervention and at three and six month follow‐up. Search methods Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), AMED (EBSCO) and CINAHL (Ovid) were conducted up to 30 October 2013. Searches of reference lists were conducted and authors in the field were contacted to identify additional relevant articles. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mind‐body interventions for adults with fibromyalgia were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted the data and assessed trials for low, unclear or high risk of bias. Any discrepancy was resolved through discussion and consensus. Continuous outcomes were analysed using mean difference (MD) where the same outcome measure and scoring method was used and standardised mean difference (SMD) where different outcome measures were used. For binary data standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used. Main results Seventy‐four papers describing 61 trials were identified, with 4234 predominantly female participants. The nature of fibromyalgia varied from mild to severe across the study populations. Twenty‐six studies were classified as having a low risk of bias for all domains assessed. The findings of mind‐body therapies compared with usual care were prioritised. There is low quality evidence that in comparison to usual care controls psychological therapies have favourable effects on physical functioning (SMD ‐0.4, 95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.3, ‐7.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD ‐0.3, 95% CI ‐0.5 to ‐0.2, ‐3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale) and mood (SMD ‐0.5, 95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.3, ‐4.8% absolute change, 3 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale). There is very low quality evidence of more withdrawals in the psychological therapy group in comparison to usual care controls (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.69, 6% absolute risk difference). There is lack of evidence of a difference between the number of adverse events in the psychological therapy and control groups (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.50, 4% absolute risk difference). There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback in comparison to usual care controls had an effect on physical functioning (SMD ‐0.1, 95% CI ‐0.4 to 0.3, ‐1.2% absolute change, 1 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD ‐2.6, 95% CI ‐91.3 to 86.1, ‐2.6% absolute change) and mood (SMD 0.1, 95% CI ‐0.3 to 0.5, 1.9% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 90 scale) post‐intervention. In view of the quality of evidence we cannot be certain that biofeedback has a little or no effect on these outcomes. There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback led to more withdrawals from the study (RR 4.08, 95% CI 1.43 to 11.62, 20% absolute risk difference). No adverse events were reported. There was no advantage observed for mindfulness in comparison to usual care for physical functioning (SMD ‐0.3, 95% CI ‐0.6 to 0.1, ‐4.8% absolute change, 4 point shift on a scale 0 to 100), pain (SMD ‐0.1, CI ‐0.4 to 0.3, ‐1.3% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 10 scale), mood (SMD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.5 to 0.0, ‐3.7% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale) or withdrawals (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.72, 2% absolute risk difference) between the two groups post‐intervention. However, the quality of the evidence was very low for pain and moderate for mood and number of withdrawals. No studies reported any adverse events. Very low quality evidence revealed that movement therapies in comparison to usual care controls improved pain (MD ‐2.3, CI ‐4.2 to ‐0.4, ‐23% absolute change) and mood (MD ‐9.8, 95% CI ‐18.5 to ‐1.2, ‐16.4% absolute change) post‐intervention. There was no advantage for physical functioning (SMD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.5 to 0.2, ‐3.4% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), participant withdrawals (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.38, 11% absolute difference) or adverse events (RR 4.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 93.92, 4% absolute risk difference) between the two groups, however rare adverse events may include worsening of pain. Low quality evidence revealed that relaxation based therapies in comparison to usual care controls showed an advantage for physical functioning (MD ‐8.3, 95% CI ‐10.1 to ‐6.5, ‐10.4% absolute change) and pain (SMD ‐1.0, 95% CI ‐1.6 to ‐0.5, ‐3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 78 scale) but not for mood (SMD ‐4.4, CI ‐14.5 to 5.6, ‐7.4% absolute change) post‐intervention. There was no difference between the groups for number of withdrawals (RR 4.40, 95% CI 0.59 to 33.07, 31% absolute risk difference) and no adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions Psychological interventions therapies may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison to usual care controls but the quality of the evidence is low. Further research on the outcomes of therapies is needed to determine if positive effects identified post‐intervention are sustained. The effectiveness of biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation based therapies remains unclear as the quality of the evidence was very low or low. The small number of trials and inconsistency in the use of outcome measures across the trials restricted the analysis. Plain language summary Interventions focusing on the link between the mind and body for adults with fibromyalgia Research question What are the effects of mind and body therapy for fibromyalgia on pain, physical function, mood and side effects? What problems does fibromyalgia cause? People with fibromyalgia have chronic, widespread body pain, and often have fatigue (feeling tired), stiffness, depression and problems sleeping. What are mind‐body interventions? Mind‐body interventions include treatments such as biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies, psychological therapy and relaxation therapies. Biofeedback is when you are connected to electrical sensors that help you receive information about your body to make subtle changes in your body, such as relaxing. Mindfulness means having awareness of thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations. All mind‐body therapies make the link between thoughts, behaviour and feelings to help people to cope with their symptoms. Study characteristics We conducted a review of the effect of mind‐body therapies for adults with fibromyalgia. After searching for all relevant studies until October 2013, we found 61 studies including 4234 adults. ‐ Many studies only included female participants, but some males were included in a few studies. ‐ Participants had mild to severe fibromyalgia. ‐ Mind‐body interventions were compared to 'usual care', such as medication use. Secondary analysis also compared findings in comparison to an 'attention control therapy' which involved receiving information for the same amount of time as the mind‐body therapy. Key results at the end of treatment ‐ Low quality evidence revealed that psychological therapies improved physical functioning, pain, mood and side effects compared to usual care. More people withdrew from the psychological therapy group compared to usual care. ‐ There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain and mood between people receiving biofeedback and usual care but this may have happened by chance. More people withdrew from the biofeedback than the usual care group. No studies reported any side effects. ‐ There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain, mood and the number of withdrawals between people receiving mindfulness therapy and usual care. No studies reported any adverse events. ‐ We are uncertain whether movement therapies improve physical functioning, pain, mood, side effects or the number of people who withdrew from the treatment. There were improvements in pain and mood for people receiving movement therapies but the quality of the evidence was very low. More people withdrew and two participants reported experiencing increased pain in the intervention group. ‐ We are uncertain whether relaxation therapies improve physical functioning and pain compared to usual care because the quality of evidence was very low. There was little or no difference in mood and withdrawal from treatment between people receiving relaxation therapies and those receiving usual care. No adverse events were reported. Best estimates of what happens at the end of treatment in people with fibromyalgia when they use mind‐body therapies The main findings on the use of psychological therapies are summarised below. ‐ Physical functioning after 1 to 25 weeks (higher scores mean greater limitations) People who used psychological therapies rated their physical functioning as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (7.5% absolute improvement). ‐ Pain after 3 to 14 weeks (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain) People who used psychological therapies rated their pain as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (3.5% absolute improvement). ‐ Mood (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain) People who used psychological therapies rated their mood as 3 points lower on a scale of 20 to 80 compared to those who received usual care (4.8% absolute improvement). ‐ Withdrawing from the treatment for any reason A total of 204 out of 1000 people withdrew from psychological therapies compared with 148 out of 1000 from usual care (6% absolute improvement). ‐ Side effects Nineteen people out of 1000 who received psychological therapies experienced a side effect compared with 51 out of 1000 who had usual care (4% absolute improvement). This may have happened by chance. We do not have precise information about side effects and complications of mind‐body therapies. Rare adverse events may include worsening of pain.","2015","2019-10-02 22:49:54","2020-04-18 06:36:43","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Mindfulness; Mind‐Body Therapies [*methods]; Attention; Pain Management [methods]; Biofeedback; Exercise Movement Techniques; Fibromyalgia [*therapy]; Psychology; Psychotherapy [methods]; Relaxation Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has shown that these difficulties are often present not only for people with chronic epilepsy but also for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Despite this, there are very few published interventions that detail means to help people with newly diagnosed epilepsy manage these problems. Objectives To identify and assess possible psychological and neuropsychological interventions for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Search methods We searched the following databases on 30 June 2015: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), SCOPUS, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Selection criteria This review includes all randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort controlled studies, and prospective before and after studies which include psychological or neuropsychological interventions for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. We excluded studies that included people with epilepsy and any other psychological disorder or neurological condition. We excluded studies carried out which recruited only children. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedure expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two authors independently completed data extraction and risk of bias analysis. The results of this were cross‐checked and third author resolved any discrepancies. In the event of missing data, we contacted the study authors. Meta‐analysis was not completed due to differences in the intervention and outcomes reported in the two studies. Main results We included two randomised controlled trials assessing psychological interventions for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. One study assessed a cognitive behavioural intervention (CBI) in an adolescent population. This study was rated as low quality. One study assessed a specialist nurse intervention in an adult population. This study was rating as very low quality. We rated one study as having unclear risk of bias and one study as having high risk of bias. The CBI study indicated that this intervention could significantly reduce depressive symptoms in people with subthreshold depressive disorder. However, the study assessing the effectiveness of a nurse intervention found no significant benefit for depressive symptoms,but did find that in individuals with the least knowledge of epilepsy, a nurse intervention could increase their knowledge of epilepsy scores. Authors' conclusions Meta‐analysis was not possible as we identified only two studies and they utilised different interventions and outcome measures. Previous research has highlighted the impact of psychological and neuropsychological difficulties experienced by people with epilepsy and the negative effect this has on their quality of life. The main finding of this review is that there is a paucity of research assessing possible neuropsychological and psychological interventions for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Plain language summary Neuropsychological and psychological treatments for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy Background Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterised by involuntary activity of the brain which manifests in seizures. People with newly diagnosed epilepsy often report psychological (such as symptoms of depression or anxiety) and neuropsychological (for example, memory or thinking problems) difficulties. Despite this, there is little research into interventions for these difficulties for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. We reviewed the available evidence for these interventions within this population Study characteristics The evidence in this review is current to 30 June 2015. We found two studies that evaluated the effectiveness of psychological interventions targeting depression and anxiety symptoms in people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. One study compared the effectiveness of treatment as usual (TAU) versus usual care plus two 20‐minute appointments, three months apart, with a specialist nurse. This was conducted in a sample of 90 people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. The second study assessed the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural intervention (CBI). This approach aims to challenge individuals' negative thoughts alongside behavioural interventions such as graded exposure to situations that prompt anxiety. This entailed 12 group sessions over a six‐month period compared with an equal number of sessions in which counselling without CBI was delivered. This control group was referred to as TAU. We identified no studies that evaluated the effectiveness of neuropsychological interventions aimed at addressing memory and thinking problems. Key results There were two main findings from these studies. First, CBI was more effective than TAU in reducing self reported depressive symptoms. Second, more time spent with a medical professional may have some benefit in improving individuals' knowledge of epilepsy. Quality of evidence Of the interventions included in this review, one study enrolled people aged from 13 to 19 years (adolescents) rather than just adults and, therefore, generalising these results to all adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy is limited. The second study used an individualised patient‐led approach, in which the patient guided the content of each session. Therefore, it is difficult to determine which intervention factor(s) were effective and which were not. The content of the interventions assessed in the studies within this review was unclear. Overall, the present review identified a paucity of information for assessing the effectiveness of psychological and neuropsychological interventions for epilepsy and, therefore, we can draw no robust conclusions from the evidence presented.","2015","2019-10-02 22:49:56","2020-04-18 06:37:33","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Adult; Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [*methods]; *Practice Patterns; *psychology]; Anxiety [nursing; Depression [nursing; Epilepsy [diagnosis; Memory Disorders [therapy]; Nurses'","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to manage physical and psychological aspects of the disease and its treatment, complementary therapies like yoga are coming increasingly into focus. However, the effectiveness of yoga practice for people suffering from haematological malignancies remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of yoga practice in addition to standard cancer treatment for people with haematological malignancies. Search methods Our search strategy included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to 4th February 2014), databases of ongoing trials ( controlled‐trials.com ; clinicaltrials.gov ), conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Hematology, the European Haematology Association, the European Congress for Integrative Medicine, and Global Advances in Health and Medicine. We handsearched references of these studies from identified trials and relevant review articles. Two review authors independently screened the search results. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga in addition to standard care for haematological malignancies compared with standard care only. We did not restrict this to any specific style of yoga. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data for eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias according to predefined criteria. We evaluated distress, fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of sleep. Further outcomes we planned to assess were health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AE), but data on these were not available. Main results Our search strategies led to 149 potentially relevant references, but only a single small study met our inclusion criteria. The included study was published as a full text article and investigated the feasibility and effect of Tibetan Yoga additional to standard care (N = 20; 1 person dropped out before attending any classes and no data were collected) compared to standard care only (N = 19). The study included people with all stages of Hodgkin and non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma, with and without current cancer treatment. The mean age was 51 years. We judged the overall risk of bias as high as we found a high risk for performance, detection and attrition bias. Additionally, potential outcome reporting bias could not be completely ruled out. Following the recommendations of GRADE, we judged the overall quality of the body of evidence for all predefined outcomes as 'very low', due to the methodical limitations and the very small sample size. The influence of yoga on HRQoL and OS was not reported. There is no evidence that yoga in addition to standard care compared with standard care only can improve distress in people with haematological malignancies (mean difference (MD) ‐0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.55 to 4.95; P = 0.91). Similarly, there is no evidence of a difference between either group for fatigue (MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 0.94; P = 1.00), anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI ‐5.01 to 5.61; P = 0.91) or depression (MD ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐3.21 to 1.81; P = 0.58). There is very low quality evidence that yoga improves the overall quality of sleep (MD ‐2.30, 95% CI ‐3.78 to ‐0.82; P = 0.002). The yoga groups' total score for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was 5.8 (± 2.3 SD) and better than the total score (8.1 (± 2.4 SD)) of the control group. A PSQI total score of 0 to 5 indicates good sleep whereas PSQI total score 6 to 21 points towards significant sleep disturbances. The occurrence of AEs was not reported. Authors' conclusions The currently available data provide little information about the effectiveness of yoga interventions for people suffering from haematological malignancies. The finding that yoga may be beneficial for the patients' quality of sleep is based on a very small body of evidence. Therefore, the role of yoga as an additional therapy for haematological malignancies remains unclear. Further high‐quality randomised controlled trials with larger numbers of participants are needed to make a definitive statement. Plain language summary Yoga in addition to standard care for people with blood or lymph node cancer Background Blood and lymph node cancers are referred to as haematological malignancies. These are types of cancer that affect the blood, bone marrow and other parts of the lymphatic system. The most common ones are lymphomas, leukaemias and myelomas. Depending on the kind of cancer and how far it has spread, there are a lot of different options to manage the disease. Usually chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of both is used to treat the disease. If the cancer is widespread, a transplantation of the patients’ own bone marrow cells combined with an aggressive chemotherapy can be a treatment option. People with cancer most commonly experience high emotional distress, anxiety, fatigue, depression and sleeping problems. These symptoms can persist, even when the treatment has ended. In search of ways to manage and cope with such conditions, more and more patients are turning to complementary and alternative therapies. Yoga Yoga, originating in a thousand year old Indian tradition, is becoming more and more popular. There are hundreds of different styles of yoga, but in the Western world, yoga training mostly consists of three main elements: physical postures, breathing exercises and meditation. An increasing number of cancer patients use yoga as an additional way to improve their well‐being. However, a systematic evaluation about the effects of yoga in the management of haematological malignancies is still missing. Objectives We reviewed the evidence about the effects of yoga on people with haematological malignancies. We also considered overall survival, distress, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep quality and adverse events as important outcomes. We compared people suffering from haematological malignancies treated with yoga and standard cancer care with those treated with standard cancer care only. Findings We included a single trial with 39 participants in the review (20 in the yoga group and 19 in the control group). The trial looked at a seven‐week Tibetan Yoga program in a group of people with Hodgkin and non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma. The average age was 51 years. The trial involved patients who were currently receiving anti‐cancer therapy as well as patients who were not receiving active therapy. The trial found insufficient data to make a judgement about the efficacy of yoga on distress, fatigue, depression and anxiety compared with patients not practicing yoga. Yoga can improve the patients' quality of sleep. The trial gave no information about health‐related quality of life, overall survival or adverse events. On the basis of the GRADE criteria, we judged the overall quality of evidence for yoga concerning the outcomes distress, fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of sleep as 'very low'. Conclusion There are not enough data to say how effective yoga is in the management of haematological malignancies. Therefore, the role of yoga for haematological malignancies remains unclear. Further large, high‐quality randomised controlled trials are needed. The evidence is up‐to‐date as of 4 February 2014.","2014","2019-10-02 22:49:54","2020-04-18 08:16:03","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Felbel14 tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Health Status; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Quality of Life; Hodgkin Disease [psychology; Lymphoma; Non‐Hodgkin [psychology; Yoga [*psychology]; #duplicate-citation-key","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has a marked negative impact and is associated with self‐harm and suicide. Preventing its onset would be an important advance in public health. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was last updated in 2011. Objectives To determine whether evidence‐based psychological interventions (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT) and third wave CBT)) are effective in preventing the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group (CCMDCTR to 11 September 2015), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We searched conference abstracts and reference lists of included trials and reviews, and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of an evidence‐based psychological prevention programme compared with any comparison control for young people aged 5 to 19 years, who did not currently meet diagnostic criteria for depression. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and rated their risk of bias. We adjusted sample sizes to take account of cluster designs and multiple comparisons. We contacted trial authors for additional information where needed. We assessed the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes using GRADE. Main results We included 83 trials in this review. The majority of trials (67) were carried out in school settings with eight in colleges or universities, four in clinical settings, three in the community and four in mixed settings. Twenty‐nine trials were carried out in unselected populations and 53 in targeted populations. For the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium‐term follow‐up (up to 12 months), there were 32 trials with 5965 participants and the risk of having a diagnosis of depression was reduced for participants receiving an intervention compared to those receiving no intervention (risk difference (RD) ‐0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.05 to ‐0.01; P value = 0.01). We rated this evidence as moderate quality according to the GRADE criteria. There were 70 trials (73 trial arms) with 13,829 participants that contributed to the analysis for the primary outcome of depression symptoms (self‐rated) at the post‐intervention time point, with results showing a small but statistically significant effect (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.27 to ‐0.15; P value ¡ 0.0001). This effect persisted to the short‐term assessment point (up to three months) (SMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.17; P value ¡ 0.0001; 16 studies; 1558 participants) and medium‐term (4 to 12 months) assessment point (SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.05; P value = 0.0002; 53 studies; 11,913 participants); however, the effect was no longer evident at the long‐term follow‐up . We rated this evidence as low to moderate quality according to the GRADE criteria. The evidence from this review is unclear with regard to whether the type of population modified the overall effects; there was statistically significant moderation of the overall effect for depression symptoms (P value = 0.0002), but not for depressive disorder (P value = 0.08). For trials implemented in universal populations there was no effect for depression diagnosis (RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01) and a small effect for depression symptoms (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.17 to ‐0.05). For trials implemented in targeted populations there was a statistically significantly beneficial effect of intervention (depression diagnosis RD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.07 to ‐0.01; depression symptoms SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.23). Of note were the lack of attention placebo‐controlled trials in targeted populations (none for depression diagnosis and four for depression symptoms). Among trials implemented in universal populations a number used an attention placebo comparison in which the intervention consistently showed no effect. Authors' conclusions Overall the results show small positive benefits of depression prevention, for both the primary outcomes of self‐rated depressive symptoms post‐intervention and depression diagnosis up to 12 months (but not beyond). Estimates of numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB = 11) compare well with other public health interventions. However, the evidence was of moderate to low quality using the GRADE framework and the results were heterogeneous. Prevention programmes delivered to universal populations showed a sobering lack of effect when compared with an attention placebo control. Interventions delivered to targeted populations, particularly those selected on the basis of depression symptoms, had larger effect sizes, but these seldom used an attention placebo comparison and there are practical difficulties inherent in the implementation of targeted programmes. We conclude that there is still not enough evidence to support the implementation of depression prevention programmes. Future research should focus on current gaps in our knowledge. Given the relative lack of evidence for universal interventions compared with attention placebo controls and the poor results from well‐conducted effectiveness trials of universal interventions, in our opinion any future such trials should test a depression prevention programme in an indicated targeted population using a credible attention placebo comparison group. Depressive disorder as the primary outcome should be measured over the longer term, as well as clinician‐rated depression. Such a trial should consider scalability as well as the potential for the intervention to do harm. Plain language summary Evidence‐based psychological interventions for preventing depression in children and adolescents The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of evidence‐based psychological interventions designed to prevent the onset of a depressive disorder and to reduce any existing symptoms of depression. Who may be interested in this review? People involved in public health initiatives, school personnel and mental health clinicians. Why is this review important? Depressive disorder is common. It is associated with a negative impact on the functioning of young people and is expensive to society at large. Finding a way to prevent the onset of depressive disorder has the potential to make an important impact on the burden of depression in young people. What questions does this review aim to answer? Whether psychological depression prevention programmes designed to prevent the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents are effective. Which trials were included in the review? We included 83 studies (in particular randomised controlled trials) of evidence‐based psychotherapy interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and third wave CBT, interpersonal therapy) that had the specific aim of preventing the onset of depressive disorder. For the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium‐term follow‐up (up to 12 months), there were 32 trials with 5965 participants and for the primary outcome of depression symptoms (self‐rated) there were 73 trials with 13,829 participants. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We found that, compared with any comparison group, psychological depression prevention programmes have small positive benefits on depression prevention. There were some problems with the way the trials were done and in particular the results showed that compared to an attention placebo comparison group (a control intervention that controls for non‐specific factors like involvement in a trial and attention from researchers), these programmes had no effect. There is still not enough evidence to support the implementation of depression prevention programmes. However, based on the effects seen for targeted depression prevention programmes (albeit with inadequate control groups), we recommend that further research be undertaken to test the effectiveness of depression prevention programmes in populations of young people who already have some symptoms of depression. Such trials should compare the intervention to an attention placebo comparison group and measure whether depressive diagnosis is prevented in the long term. They also need to consider whether the approach is something that can be implemented in the real world. In addition, they should consider and measure whether the intervention produces harmful outcomes.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:54","2020-04-18 06:34:18","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Female; Humans; Male; Child; Adolescent; Preschool; Young Adult; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *prevention & control]; Psychotherapy [methods]; Depression [diagnosis; Depressive Disorder [diagnosis; Program Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non‐epileptic seizures can occur in isolation or in combination with epileptic seizures. The development and maintenance of non‐epileptic seizures has been well documented and there is a growing literature on the treatment of non‐epileptic seizures which includes non‐psychological (including anti‐anxiety and antidepressant pharmacological treatment) and psychological therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy and paradoxical therapy). Various treatment methodologies have been tried with variable success. The purpose of this Cochrane review was to establish the evidence base for the treatment of non‐epileptic seizures with behavioural and psychological therapies only. Objectives To assess whether behavioural or psychological treatments for non‐epileptic seizures or NEAD result in a reduction in the frequency of seizures or improvement in quality of life, or both, and whether any treatment is significantly more effective than others. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (4 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1) (January 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to 4 February 2013), PsycINFO (4 February 2013) and SCOPUS (4 February 2013). No language restrictions were imposed. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and before and after controlled and non‐controlled studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies were required to assess one or more types of behavioural or psychological interventions, or both, for the treatment of non‐epileptic seizures. Studies of childhood non‐epileptic seizures were excluded from our review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (JM, JP) independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included reduction in seizure frequency and improvements in quality of life. Main results Twelve studies, with a total of 343 participants, met our inclusion criteria (four RCTs and eight before and after non‐controlled studies). Of the four RCTs, one examined patients with non‐epileptic seizures and three had a mixed diagnosis (pseudoseizures, conversion disorder and somatisation disorder). Most of the non‐randomised studies used non‐epileptic seizure patients exclusively. Overall, five studies examined the effectiveness of psychotherapy, three examined CBT, two investigated hypnosis, one assessed paradoxical intention and one had a mixed intervention design. We classified two included studies as low risk of bias, one as unclear and nine as high risk of bias. Meta‐analysis could not be undertaken due to the heterogeneity of design and interventions. Most included studies reported improved outcomes for the intervention under investigation. One RCT investigating the effectiveness of CBT in this patient group found a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to controls (P ¡ 0.001). Authors' conclusions There is little reliable evidence to support the use of any treatment, including CBT, in the treatment of non‐epileptic seizures. Further randomised controlled trials of CBT and other interventions are needed. Plain language summary Psychological and behavioural treatments for non‐epileptic attack disorder Non‐epileptic attacks look like epileptic seizures but they are not caused by epilepsy. There have been many investigations of the causes, but evidence about successful treatment is less available. We reviewed the existing studies treating people having non‐epileptic attacks. We found 12 studies looking at different types of treatment such as psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnosis. Three hundred and forty three participants were recruited to these 12 studies. Four studies were randomised controlled trials, and 8 were non‐randomised studies. Most of the controlled trials included patients with other diagnoses as well as non‐epileptic attacks. Most of the non‐randomised studies included patients with mainly non‐epileptic attacks. Most included studies reported improved outcomes for the treatment they were investigating. One randomised trial investigating Cognitive Behavioural Therapy found that seizures were significantly reduced. Due to the variety of treatments and designs of the included studies, it was not possible to combine the results to produce an overall outcome for our review. Many of the studies did not use satisfactory methods which meant that the evidence was rated as high risk of bias. The overall evidence for the main outcome of reducing seizures as a result of treatment is not considered reliable except in one study. Our conclusion is there is little reliable evidence to support the use of any treatment for people with non‐epileptic attacks. The evidence in this review is up to date as from 4 February 2013.","2014","2019-10-02 22:49:53","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Martlew07","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *therapy]; Hypnosis [methods]; Quality of Life; Psychotherapy [methods]; Seizures [etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is associated with poorer asthma control, medication adherence, and health outcomes. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be a way to improve the quality of life of people with asthma by addressing associated psychological issues, which may lead to a lower risk of exacerbations and better asthma control. Objectives To assess the efficacy of CBT for asthma compared with usual care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). We also searched reference lists of all primary studies and review articles and contacted authors for unpublished data. The most recent searches were conducted in August 2016. Selection criteria We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any cognitive behavioural intervention to usual care or no intervention. We included studies of adults or adolescents with asthma, with or without comorbid anxiety or depression. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. Data collection and analysis Two or more review authors independently screened the search results, extracted data, and assessed included studies for risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMD) where scales varied across studies, all using a random‐effects model. The primary outcomes were asthma‐related quality of life and exacerbations requiring at least a course of oral steroids. We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented our confidence in the results in a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included nine RCTs involving 407 adults with asthma in this review; no studies included adolescents under 18. Study size ranged from 10 to 94 (median 40), and mean age ranged from 39 to 53. Study populations generally had persistent asthma, but severity and diagnostic measures varied. Three studies recruited participants with psychological symptomatology, although with different criteria. Interventions ranged from 4 to 15 sessions, and primary measurements were taken at a mean of 3 months (range 1.2 to 12 months). Participants given CBT had improved scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (MD 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.93; participants = 214; studies = 6; I 2 = 53%) and on measures of asthma control (SMD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.76 to ‐0.20; participants = 95; studies = 3; I 2 = 68%) compared to people getting usual care. The AQLQ effect appeared to be sustained up to a year after treatment, but due to its low quality this evidence must be interpreted with caution. As asthma exacerbations requiring at least a course of oral steroids were not consistently reported, we could not perform a meta‐analysis. Anxiety scores were difficult to pool but showed a benefit of CBT compared with usual care (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.73 to ‐0.03), although this depended on the analysis used. The confidence intervals for the effect on depression scales included no difference between CBT and usual care when measured as change from baseline (SMD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.05) or endpoint scores (SMD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐0.87 to 0.05); the same was true for medication adherence (MD ‐1.40, 95% CI ‐2.94 to 0.14; participants = 23; studies = 1; I 2 = 0%). Subgroup analyses conducted on the AQLQ outcome did not suggest a clear difference between individual and group CBT, baseline psychological status, or CBT model. The small number of studies and the variation between their designs, populations, and other intervention characteristics limited the conclusions that could be drawn about these possibly moderating factors. The inability to blind participants and investigators to group allocation introduced significant potential bias, and overall we had low confidence in the evidence. Authors' conclusions For adults with persistent asthma, CBT may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels compared with usual care. Risks of bias, imprecision of effects, and inconsistency between results reduced our confidence in the results to low, and evidence was lacking regarding the effect of CBT on asthma exacerbations, unscheduled contacts, depression, and medication adherence. There was much variation between studies in how CBT was delivered and what constituted usual care, meaning the most optimal method of CBT delivery, format, and target population requires further investigation. There is currently no evidence for the use of CBT in adolescents with asthma. Plain language summary Cognitive behavioural therapy for people with asthma Take‐home message Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may improve the quality of life and asthma control of adults with asthma, but there is limited evidence for other important outcomes, and our confidence in the results is quite low. None of the studies included adolescents with asthma. Review question We wanted to review the evidence of the effect of CBT compared to usual care (without CBT) on a range of health outcomes in people with asthma including quality of life, medication adherence, and levels of anxiety and depression. Background People with asthma suffer from anxiety and depression more than the general public. These psychological problems are linked with having worse asthma, including having poorer control of symptoms and being admitted to hospital more often. CBT is a talking therapy that aims to help people recognise how their behaviour affects their thoughts and feelings, which may help people with asthma better cope with their condition. We wanted to learn whether using CBT was better than not using CBT for improving the lives of people with asthma. Study characteristics The evidence reviewed is current to August 2016. We included nine studies with a total of 407 participants in the review. All of the participants had asthma. In three of the nine studies, the participants also had a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or both. The CBT was given either individually or in a group and ranged from four to 15 sessions. Key results Participants given CBT had improved scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and on measures of asthma control compared to participants who did not receive CBT. The studies generally did not report whether CBT reduced the likelihood of people needing oral steroids for an asthma attack. The benefit on AQLQ score was sustained up to a year after receiving CBT. Participants given CBT also had better anxiety scores compared to those given usual care. Participants given CBT did not have clearly improved depression scale scores or medication adherence. The overall quality of evidence presented is low due to the small number of studies included in the review, the differences in the design of the studies and in how the CBT was conducted, and because the participants knew to which treatment group (CBT or no CBT) they had been assigned.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:53","2020-04-18 06:34:12","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression, sometimes directly related to their illness or medical care (e.g. health‐related anxiety). There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in this population. Therapies designed for children and adolescents without medical issues may or may not be appropriate for use with those who have long‐term physical conditions. Objectives This review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies in comparison with controls (treatment‐as‐usual, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or non‐psychological treatment) for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 27 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to May 2016). In addition, we searched the Web of Science (Core Collection) (12 October 2018) and conducted a cited reference search for reports of all included trials. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and grey literature. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials and cross‐over trials of psychological therapies for treating anxiety or depression in children with long‐term physical conditions were included. Data collection and analysis Abstracts and complete articles were independently reviewed by two authors. Discrepancies were addressed by a third author. Odds ratio (OR) was used for comparing dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) for comparing continuous data. Meta‐analysis was undertaken when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar. Otherwise, narrative analysis of data was undertaken. Main results Twenty‐eight RCTs and one cross‐over trial with 1349 participants were included in the review. Most participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high‐income countries. For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short‐term depression (versus any control), there was low‐quality evidence from 16 trials involving 1121 participants suggesting that psychological therapies may be more effective than control therapies (SMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.03; I 2 = 79%). For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short‐term anxiety (versus any control), there was inadequate evidence of moderate‐quality from 13 studies involving 578 participants to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions (SMD ‐0.26, CI ‐0.59 to 0.07, I 2 = 72%). Planned sensitivity analyses could not be undertaken for risk of bias due to the small number of trials that rated high for each domain. Additional sensitivity analysis demonstrated that psychological interventions specifically designed to reduce anxiety or depression were more effective than psychological therapies designed to improve other symptoms or general coping. There was some suggestion from subgroup analyses that they type of intervention (Chi² = 14.75, df = 5 (P = 0.01), I² = 66.1%), the severity of depression (Chi² = 23.29, df = 4 (P = 0.0001), I² = 82.8%) and the type of long‐term physical condition (Chi² = 10.55, df = 4 (P = 0.03), I² = 62.1%) may have an impact on the overall treatment effect.There was qualitative (reported), but not quantitative evidence confirming the acceptability of selected psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. There was low‐quality evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions in improving quality of life (SMD 1.13, CI 0.44 to 1.82, I 2 = 89%) and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions (SMD ‐0.34, CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.06, I 2 = 70%), but only in the short term. There was inadequate low‐quality evidence to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions at improving functioning in either the short term or long term. No trials of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety were identified and only two trials reported adverse effects; these were unrelated to psychological therapies. Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality, results were heterogeneous, and only one trial had an available protocol. Authors' conclusions A limited number of trials of variable quality have been undertaken to assess whether psychological therapies are effective for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. According to the available evidence, therapies specifically designed to treat anxiety or depression (especially those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)) may be more likely to work in children and adolescents who have mild to moderate levels of symptoms of these disorders, at least in the short term. There is a dearth of therapies specifically designed to treat health‐related anxiety in this age group. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions Why is this review important? More than one in ten children and adolescents have long‐term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. Who will be interested in this review? This review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? Which studies were included in the review? We searched a number of databases to find all high‐quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long‐term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty‐nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. What does the evidence from the review tell us? A handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long‐term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety in this population. What should happen next? Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.","2018","2019-10-02 22:49:52","2019-11-05 22:03:06","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Citation Key: Thabrew18","","","","Humans; Child; Adolescent; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Anxiety [*therapy]; Depression [*therapy]; Chronic Disease [*psychology]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Search methods We searched ALOIS ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 9 of 12, 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1950 to September 2017), Embase (Ovid SP 1974 to Sepetmber 2017), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science 1945 to September 2017), PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to September 2017), CINAHL (all dates to September 2017), LILACS (all dates to September 2017), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to 6 September 2017, with no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MBSR for family carers of people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened references for inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information, then conducted meta‐analyses, or reported results narratively in the case of insufficient data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included five RCTs involving 201 carers assessing the effectiveness of MBSR. Controls used in included studies varied in structure and content. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction programmes were compared with either active controls (those matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. education, social support, or progressive muscle relaxation), or inactive controls (those not matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. self help education or respite care). One trial used both active and inactive comparisons with MBSR. All studies were at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about selective reporting, incomplete outcome data, or allocation concealment. 1. Compared with active controls, MBSR may reduce depressive symptoms of carers at the end of the intervention (3 trials, 135 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.98 to ‐0.28; P¡0.001; low‐quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low‐quality evidence). Mindfulness‐based stress reduction compared with active control may decrease carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 78 participants; mean difference (MD) ‐7.50, 95% CI ‐13.11 to ‐1.89; P¡0.001; low‐quality evidence) and may slightly increase carer burden (3 trials, 135 participants; SMD 0.24, 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.58; P=0.18; low‐quality evidence), although both results were imprecise, and we could not exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be sure of any effect on carers' coping style, nor could we determine whether carers were more or less likely to drop out of treatment. 2. Compared with inactive controls, MBSR showed no clear evidence of any effect on depressive symptoms (2 trials, 50 participants; MD ‐1.97, 95% CI ‐6.89 to 2.95; P=0.43; low‐quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low‐quality evidence). In this comparison, MBSR may also reduce carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 33 participants; MD ‐7.27, 95% CI ‐14.92 to 0.38; P=0.06; low‐quality evidence), although we were unable to exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be certain of any effects of MBSR on carer burden, the use of positive coping strategies, or dropout rates. We found no studies that looked at quality of life of carers or care‐recipients, or institutionalisation. Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting a single adverse event related to yoga practices at home Authors' conclusions After accounting for non‐specific effects of the intervention (i.e. comparing it with an active control), low‐quality evidence suggests that MBSR may reduce carers' depressive symptoms and anxiety, at least in the short term. There are significant limitations to the evidence base on MBSR in this population. Our GRADE assessment of the evidence was low to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence primarily because of high risk of detection or performance bias, and imprecision. In conclusion, MBSR has the potential to meet some important needs of the carer, but more high‐quality studies in this field are needed to confirm its efficacy. Plain language summary Mindfulness‐based stress reduction for family carers of people with dementia Review question How effective is mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) in reducing stress‐related problems of family carers of people with dementia? Background Dementia has become a public health burden worldwide. Caring for people with dementia is highly stressful, thus carers are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, than general population. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction is a potentially promising intervention to target these issues. More information is needed about whether MBSR can help family carers of people with dementia. Study characteristics We searched for evidence up to September 2017 and found five randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing MBSR to a variety of other interventions. We reported the effects of MBSR programmes compared with active controls (interventions in which participants received a similar amount of attention to those in the MBSR group, such as social support or progressive muscle relaxation) or inactive controls (interventions in which participants received less attention than those in the MBSR group, such as self help education). Key results We were able to analyse study data from five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 201 carers. Findings from three studies (135 carers) showed that carers receiving MBSR may have a lower level of depressive symptoms at the end of treatment than those receiving an active control treatment. However, we found no clear evidence of any effect on depression when MBSR was compared with an inactive control treatment. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction may also lead to a reduction in carers' anxiety symptoms at the end of treatment. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction may slightly increase carers' feelings of burden. However, the results on anxiety and burden were very uncertain. We were unable to draw conclusions about carers' coping strategies and the risk of dropping out of treatment due to the very low quality of the evidence. None of the studies measured quality of life of carers or people with dementia, or the rate of admission of people with dementia to care homes or hospitals. Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting one minor adverse event (neck strain in one participant practising yoga at home) Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, mainly because the studies were small and the way they were designed or conducted put them at risk of giving biased results. Consequently, we have limited confidence in the results. Conclusion To summarise, the review provides preliminary evidence on the effect of MBSR in treating some stress‐related problems of family carers of people with dementia. More good‐quality studies are needed before we can confirm whether or not MBSR is beneficial for family carers of people with dementia.","2018","2019-10-02 22:49:51","2020-04-18 06:37:12","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stress; Psychological [*prevention & control]; Anxiety [prevention & control]; Caregivers [*psychology]; Dementia [*nursing]; Depression [prevention & control]; Family [*psychology]; Mindfulness [*methods]; Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need to explore options for long‐term sustainable interventions that support stroke survivors to engage in meaningful activities to address life challenges after stroke. Rehabilitation focuses on recovery of function and cognition to the maximum level achievable, and may include a wide range of complementary strategies including yoga. Yoga is a mind‐body practice that originated in India, and which has become increasingly widespread in the Western world. Recent evidence highlights the positive effects of yoga for people with a range of physical and psychological health conditions. A recent non‐Cochrane systematic review concluded that yoga can be used as self‐administered practice in stroke rehabilitation. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of yoga, as a stroke rehabilitation intervention, on recovery of function and quality of life (QoL). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched July 2017), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last searched July 2017), MEDLINE (to July 2017), Embase (to July 2017), CINAHL (to July 2017), AMED (to July 2017), PsycINFO (to July 2017), LILACS (to July 2017), SciELO (to July 2017), IndMED (to July 2017), OTseeker (to July 2017) and PEDro (to July 2017). We also searched four trials registers, and one conference abstracts database. We screened reference lists of relevant publications and contacted authors for additional information. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared yoga with a waiting‐list control or no intervention control in stroke survivors. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We performed all analyses using Review Manager (RevMan). One review author entered the data into RevMan; another checked the entries. We discussed disagreements with a third review author until consensus was reached. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Where we considered studies to be sufficiently similar, we conducted a meta‐analysis by pooling the appropriate data. For outcomes for which it was inappropriate or impossible to pool quantitatively, we conducted a descriptive analysis and provided a narrative summary. Main results We included two RCTs involving 72 participants. Sixty‐nine participants were included in one meta‐analysis (balance). Both trials assessed QoL, along with secondary outcomes measures relating to movement and psychological outcomes; one also measured disability. In one study the Stroke Impact Scale was used to measure QoL across six domains, at baseline and post‐intervention. The effect of yoga on five domains (physical, emotion, communication, social participation, stroke recovery) was not significant; however, the effect of yoga on the memory domain was significant (mean difference (MD) 15.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 29.31, P = 0.03), the evidence for this finding was very low grade. In the second study, QoL was assessed using the Stroke‐Specifc QoL Scale; no significant effect was found. Secondary outcomes included movement, strength and endurance, and psychological variables, pain, and disability. Balance was measured in both studies using the Berg Balance Scale; the effect of intervention was not significant (MD 2.38, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 6.17, P = 0.22). Sensititivy analysis did not alter the direction of effect. One study measured balance self‐efficacy, using the Activities‐specific Balance Confidence Scale (MD 10.60, 95% CI ‐7.08,= to 28.28, P = 0.24); the effect of intervention was not significant; the evidence for this finding was very low grade. One study measured gait using the Comfortable Speed Gait Test (MD 1.32, 95% CI ‐1.35 to 3.99, P = 0.33), and motor function using the Motor Assessment Scale (MD ‐4.00, 95% CI ‐12.42 to 4.42, P = 0.35); no significant effect was found based on very low‐grade evidence. One study measured disability using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) but reported only whether participants were independent or dependent. No significant effect was found: (odds ratio (OR) 2.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 8.60, P = 0.31); the evidence for this finding was very low grade. Anxiety and depression were measured in one study. Three measures were used: the Geriatric Depression Scale‐Short Form (GCDS15), and two forms of State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Form Y) to measure state anxiety (i.e. anxiety experienced in response to stressful situations) and trait anxiety (i.e. anxiety associated with chronic psychological disorders). No significant effect was found for depression (GDS15, MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐4.70 to 0.50, P = 0.11) or for trait anxiety (STAI‐Y2, MD ‐6.70, 95% CI ‐15.35 to 1.95, P = 0.13), based on very low‐grade evidence. However, a significant effect was found for state anxiety: STAI‐Y1 (MD ‐8.40, 95% CI ‐16.74 to ‐0.06, P = 0.05); the evidence for this finding was very low grade. No adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, due to the small number of trials included in the review both of which were judged to be at high risk of bias, particularly in relation to incompleteness of data and selective reporting, and especially regarding the representative nature of the sample in one study. Authors' conclusions Yoga has the potential for being included as part of patient‐centred stroke rehabilitation. However, this review has identified insufficient information to confirm or refute the effectiveness or safety of yoga as a stroke rehabilitation treatment. Further large‐scale methodologically robust trials are required to establish the effectiveness of yoga as a stroke rehabilitation treatment. Plain language summary Yoga for stroke rehabilitation Review question We wanted to know if yoga helps to improve quality of life for stroke survivors. Background Stroke is a major health issue worldwide, which affects people in many different ways. For example, stroke survivors may have problems moving around, and communicating and socialising with other people. Stroke may also affect how people feel. It may cause problems with memory and concentration. After discharge from hospital or other stroke services, stroke survivors have to cope with the long‐term effects of stroke. Research has shown that yoga can help people with other long‐term conditions to cope better. Yoga can improve quality of life (QoL). Search date We searched for studies published to July 2017. Study characteristics We found two research studies that had assessed yoga for stroke survivors. Seventy‐two people took part in the two studies. One study was in the USA and one was in Australia. On average, the stroke survivors were between 60 and 63 years old and it had been between four years three months and nine years since they had had a stroke. In the American study, yoga classes were held twice a week for eight weeks. In the Australian study, yoga classes were held once a week for 10 weeks. Both studies encouraged people to practice yoga at home, in their own time. Both studies used waiting‐list control groups. This means that people in the control group could go to yoga classes at the end of the study. Funding sources The American study was funded by the US Government. The Austrailian study was funded by the National Stroke Foundation (Australia). Key results We were able to analyse study data from 69 participants. No significant benefit was found on measures of QoL, balance, strength, endurance, pain, disability scores. No significant benefit was found on measures of movement, although one study reported a significant benefit in improving aspects of range of movement. One study reported a significant benefit in reducing anxiety. Neither study reported on measures of patient harm. Quality of the evidence We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, due to the small number of trials included in the review, both of which we judged to be at high risk of bias, particularly in relation to incompleteness of data and selective reporting, and especially regarding the representative nature of the sample in one study. Conclusion The review could not identify enough high‐quality evidence on the benefits and safety of yoga in stroke rehabilitation. More good‐quality research studies are needed to be sure that yoga has benefits for stroke survivors.","2017","2019-10-02 22:49:51","2020-04-18 08:29:38","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; psychology]; *Yoga; Quality of Life; Memory; Anxiety [diagnosis]; Communication; Depression [diagnosis]; Emotions; Gait; Postural Balance; Recovery of Function; Social Participation; Stroke Rehabilitation [*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Access to face‐to‐face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e‐health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of e‐health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting‐list controls, or non‐psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 ‐ 18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross‐search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand‐searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating any type of long‐term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long‐term physical conditions as those that were more than three‐months' duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient‐ or clinician‐administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 ( American Psychological Association 2013 ), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria ( World Health Organization 1992 ). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non‐psychological therapies were eligible comparators. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta‐analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis. Main results We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta‐analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries. For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low‐quality evidence that e‐health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants). For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.83, 95% CI ‐1.53 to ‐0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long‐term physical condition, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants). The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors. Authors' conclusions At present, the field of e‐health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low‐quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. Although it is too early to recommend e‐health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically‐based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Plain language summary E‐health interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions Why is this review important? More than one in ten children and adolescents worldwide have long‐term physical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems, which include anxiety or depression. Treating such problems early can prevent difficulties with friendships, family life, school, and future mental health problems. Accessing traditionally delivered face‐to‐face therapy can be difficult, due to the limited number of services. As technology improves, and therapies become available on computers and mobile telephones, e‐health interventions (delivered by digital means and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) may be useful to treat anxiety and depression in these children and adolescents. Who will be interested in this review? This review will be of interest to parents, children and adolescents, mental healthcare providers, service commissioners, and professionals caring for children with long‐term physical conditions. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review aimed to answer the following questions: 1) Are e‐health interventions better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are e‐health interventions acceptable to these children and adolescents? Which studies were included in the review? We searched reference databases to find all randomised controlled trials, cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions that were published between 1970 and August 2017. Trials had to be randomised controlled trials that included children and young people with either symptoms or formal diagnoses of anxiety or depression. We included five trials, with a total of 463 young people, in the review. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We included five trials of three e‐health interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), undertaken with children aged 10 to 18 years old. Although some of these interventions were acceptable to users, none of them were clearly any better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list at reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression.The very low quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. The review authors rated the overall risk of bias in the trials as high or uncertain. What should happen next? Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective e‐health interventions to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.","2018","2019-10-02 22:49:53","2020-04-18 06:34:46","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Humans; Child; Adolescent; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [*methods]; Treatment Outcome; Anxiety [*therapy]; Depression [*therapy]; Chronic Disease [*psychology]; Breathing Exercises [*methods]; Telemedicine [*methods]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a distressing diagnosis and, as a result, considerable research has examined the psychological sequelae of being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. Breast cancer is associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety and reduced quality of life. As a consequence, multiple studies have explored the impact of psychological interventions on the psychological distress experienced after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Objectives To assess the effects of psychological interventions on psychological morbidities, quality of life and survival among women with non‐metastatic breast cancer. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 16 May 2013: the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO; and reference lists of articles. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials in addition to handsearching. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of psychological interventions for non‐metastatic breast cancer in women. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently appraised and extracted data from eligible trials. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Extracted data included information about participants, methods, the intervention and outcome. Main results Twenty‐eight randomised controlled trials comprising 3940 participants were included. The most frequent reasons for exclusion were non‐randomised trials and the inclusion of women with metastatic disease. A wide range of interventions were evaluated, with 24 trials investigating a cognitive behavioural therapy and four trials investigating psychotherapy compared to control. Pooled standardised mean differences (SMD) from baseline indicated less depression (SMD ‐1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.83 to ‐0.18; P = 0.02; 7 studies, 637 participants, I 2 = 95%, low quality evidence ), anxiety (SMD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.76 to ‐0.21; P = 0.0006; 8 studies, 776 participants, I 2 = 64%, low quality evidence ) and mood disturbance (SMD ‐0.28, 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.13; P = 0.0003; 8 studies, 1536 participants, I 2 = 47%, moderate quality evidence ) for the cognitive behavioural therapy group than the control group. For quality of life, only an individually‐delivered cognitive behavioural intervention showed significantly better quality of life than the control with an SMD of 0.65 (95% CI 0.07 to 1.23; P = 0.03; 3 studies, 141 participants, I 2 = 41%, very low quality evidence ). Pooled data from two group‐delivered studies showed a non‐significant overall survival benefit favouring cognitive behavioural therapy compared to control (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.32; P = 0.63; 530 participants, I 2 = 84%, low quality evidence ). Four studies compared psychotherapy to control with one to two studies reporting on each outcome. The four studies were assessed as high risk of bias and provided limited evidence of the efficacy of psychotherapy. Adverse events were not reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions A psychological intervention, namely cognitive behavioural therapy, produced favourable effects on some psychological outcomes, in particular anxiety, depression and mood disturbance. However, the evidence for survival improvement is still lacking. These findings are open to criticism because of the notable heterogeneity across the included studies and the shortcomings of the included studies. Plain language summary Use of psychological interventions in women diagnosed and under treatment for non‐metastatic breast cancer Review question We reviewed the evidence for the effect of psychological interventions on the psychological impact, quality of life and survival among women with non‐metastatic breast cancer (that is cancer that has not spread beyond the breast). Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. Being a distressing diagnosis, considerable research has examined the psychological consequences of being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment can cause depression and anxiety and reduce quality of life. As a result, various psychological interventions have been utilised to help address the psychological distress experienced after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Study characteristics The evidence was current to May 2013. An intervention could be delivered in a group setting (group intervention), as one to one contact between a therapist and a patient (individual intervention) or in the form of couple therapy where the patient and her spouse attends the therapy sessions (couple intervention). The control group could receive educational leaflets or have access to seminars or relaxation classes. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted and 28 studies comprising 3940 participants were included. The majority (24 out of 28 studies) of interventions were based on cognitive behavioural therapy, which involves changing a person's thoughts and behaviour. Four studies used psychotherapy as the intervention. Generally, the methods for assessing outcomes (such as anxiety, depression, quality of life) after the intervention and the timing of these assessments were not uniform across studies. Key results Women who received cognitive behavioural therapy showed important reductions in anxiety, depression and mood disturbance, especially when it was delivered to groups of women. An improvement in quality of life was observed when women received individual cognitive behavioural therapy compared to the control group. The effects on survival were uncertain because the results were imprecise. The four psychotherapy studies reported limited information for each outcome. Therefore no firm conclusion could be made about the efficacy of psychotherapy. Adverse events were not reported in any of the included studies. Further research should aim to provide evidence for people to make informed decisions about whether the effects of these treatments are sustainable after discontinuation of the therapy.

Even though survival rates are continually increasing, breast cancer is often associated with long‐term psychological distress, chronic pain, fatigue and impaired quality of life. Yoga comprises advice for an ethical lifestyle, spiritual practice, physical activity, breathing exercises and meditation. It is a complementary therapy that is commonly recommended for breast cancer‐related impairments and has been shown to improve physical and mental health in people with different cancer types. Objectives To assess effects of yoga on health‐related quality of life, mental health and cancer‐related symptoms among women with a diagnosis of breast cancer who are receiving active treatment or have completed treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1), Indexing of Indian Medical Journals (IndMED), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and Clinicaltrials.gov on 29 January 2016. We also searched reference lists of identified relevant trials or reviews, as well as conference proceedings of the International Congress on Complementary Medicine Research (ICCMR), the European Congress for Integrative Medicine (ECIM) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials were eligible when they (1) compared yoga interventions versus no therapy or versus any other active therapy in women with a diagnosis of non‐metastatic or metastatic breast cancer, and (2) assessed at least one of the primary outcomes on patient‐reported instruments, including health‐related quality of life, depression, anxiety, fatigue or sleep disturbances. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently collected data on methods and results. We expressed outcomes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and conducted random‐effects model meta‐analyses. We assessed potential risk of publication bias through visual analysis of funnel plot symmetry and heterogeneity between studies by using the Chi 2 test and the I 2 statistic. We conducted subgroup analyses for current treatment status, time since diagnosis, stage of cancer and type of yoga intervention. Main results We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta‐analysis. Thirteen studies had low risk of selection bias, five studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assessment and 15 studies had low risk of attrition bias. Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate‐quality evidence showing that yoga improved health‐related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, 675 participants), reduced fatigue (pooled SMD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.75 to ‐0.20; 11 studies, 883 participants) and reduced sleep disturbances in the short term (pooled SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.40 to ‐0.09; six studies, 657 participants). The funnel plot for health‐related quality of life was asymmetrical, favouring no therapy, and the funnel plot for fatigue was roughly symmetrical . This hints at overall low risk of publication bias. Yoga did not appear to reduce depression (pooled SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.05; seven studies, 496 participants; low‐quality evidence) or anxiety (pooled SMD ‐0.53, 95% CI ‐1.10 to 0.04; six studies, 346 participants; very low‐quality evidence) in the short term and had no medium‐term effects on health‐related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 0.42; two studies, 146 participants; low‐quality evidence) or fatigue (pooled SMD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.29; two studies, 146 participants; low‐quality evidence). Investigators reported no serious adverse events. Four studies that compared yoga versus psychosocial/educational interventions provided moderate‐quality evidence indicating that yoga can reduce depression (pooled SMD ‐2.29, 95% CI ‐3.97 to ‐0.61; four studies, 226 participants), anxiety (pooled SMD ‐2.21, 95% CI ‐3.90 to ‐0.52; three studies, 195 participants) and fatigue (pooled SMD ‐0.90, 95% CI ‐1.31 to ‐0.50; two studies, 106 participants) in the short term. Very low‐quality evidence showed no short‐term effects on health‐related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.81, 95% CI ‐0.50 to 2.12; two studies, 153 participants) or sleep disturbances (pooled SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.76 to 0.34; two studies, 119 participants). No trial adequately reported safety‐related data. Three studies that compared yoga versus exercise presented very low‐quality evidence showing no short‐term effects on health‐related quality of life (pooled SMD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.23; three studies, 233 participants) or fatigue (pooled SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.66 to 0.25; three studies, 233 participants); no trial provided safety‐related data. Authors' conclusions Moderate‐quality evidence supports the recommendation of yoga as a supportive intervention for improving health‐related quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances when compared with no therapy, as well as for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue, when compared with psychosocial/educational interventions. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes. Plain language summary Yoga for women with a diagnosis of breast cancer What is the issue? Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Although the number of women who survive breast cancer is increasing, those women often suffer from psychological or physical problems. We wanted to find out whether yoga can improve quality of life, mental health and symptoms related to cancer in women with a diagnosis of breast cancer. We included all forms of yoga but excluded multi‐modal interventions such as mindfulness‐based stress reduction. Why does it matter? Many women with a diagnosis of breast cancer try yoga as a means of coping with their symptoms. Thus, it is important to find out whether yoga can really help these women. It is also important to find out whether any risks are associated with practising yoga. What did we find? We found 24 studies that involved 2166 women. Our evidence is current to January 2016. We found that women in 11 studies had completed surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy; women in three studies were currently undergoing chemotherapy; and women in five studies were currently undergoing radiotherapy. Women in the remaining five studies were either undergoing treatment or were not. Studies used a variety of questionnaires to assess quality of life, depression, fatigue and/or sleep disturbances. We found that yoga was more effective than no therapy in improving quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances. We also found that yoga was better for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue in women when compared with psychosocial or educational interventions such as counselling. We are fairly certain that these observed results are probably true. Yoga might be as effective as exercise in improving quality of life and reducing fatigue; we do not have enough data to be sure. Studies have poorly reported risks of yoga. However, we found no evidence of serious risks of yoga among women with a diagnosis of breast cancer. No studies have assessed effects of yoga in women given a diagnosis of breast cancer more than five years ago. What does this mean? Our findings indicate that women with a diagnosis of breast cancer can use yoga as supportive therapy for improving their quality of life and mental health, in addition to standard cancer treatments.","2017","2019-10-02 22:49:52","2020-04-18 08:16:01","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Cramer17 tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Female; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *Yoga; Depression [etiology; therapy]; Fatigue [etiology; *Quality of Life; *Mental Health; *psychology; Anxiety [etiology; Breast Neoplasms [*complications; Sleep Wake Disorders [etiology; #duplicate-citation-key","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complementary and alternative treatment options such as meditation practice or yoga are becoming popular by treating all aspects of the disease including physical and psychological symptoms. However, there is still unclear evidence about meditation's effectiveness, and how its practice affects the lives of haematologically‐diseased patients. Objectives This review aims to assess the benefits and harms of meditation practice as an additional treatment to standard care for adults with haematological malignancies. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 8, 2015), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2015), databases of ongoing trials, the meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( http://www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct/ ), conference proceedings of annual meetings of: the American Society of Hematology; American Society of Clinical Oncology; European Hematology Association; European Congress for Integrative Medicine; and Global Advances in Health and Medicine (2010 to 2015). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using meditation practice for adult patients with haematological malignancies. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias according to predefined criteria. We evaluated quality of life and depression. The other outcomes of overall survival, anxiety, fatigue, quality of sleep and adverse events could not be evaluated, because they were not assessed in the included trial. Main results We included only one small trial published as an abstract article. The included study investigated the effects of meditation practice on patients newly hospitalised with acute leukaemia. Ninety‐one participants enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the trial throughout the six‐month follow‐up period and were eligible for analysis. There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population. We found a high risk for attrition bias and unclear risk for reporting bias, performance and detection bias because of missing data due to abstract publication only, thus we judged the overall risk of bias as high. According to the GRADE criteria, we judged the overall quality of the body of evidence for all predefined outcomes as 'very low', due to the extent of missing data on the study population, and the small sample size. As the abstract publication did not provide numbers and results except P values, we are not able to give more details. Meditation practice might be beneficial for the quality of life of haematologically‐diseased patients, with higher scores for participants in the mediation arms compared to the participants in the usual care control group (low quality of evidence). Levels of depression decreased for those practising meditation in both the spiritually‐framed meditation group and the secularly‐focused meditation group in comparison to the usual care control group, whose levels of depression remained constant (low quality of evidence). The influence of meditation practice on overall survival, fatigue, anxiety, quality of sleep and adverse events remained unclear, as these outcomes were not evaluated in the included trial. Authors' conclusions To estimate the effects of meditation practice for patients suffering from haematological malignancies, more high quality randomised controlled trials are needed. At present there is not enough information available on the effects of meditation in haematologically‐diseased patients to draw any conclusion. Plain language summary Meditation for adults with haematological malignancies Background Cancers of the bone marrow, lymphatic tissue and blood are considered as haematological malignancies. The most common types of haematological malignancies are lymphoma, leukaemia and myeloma but they also include myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative diseases. Within each type of disease there are various sub‐divisions. There are several treatment options depending on the type and severity of the cancer. The most common therapies are chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of both. In some cases, stem cell transplantation is offered (this is where either the patient's own bone marrow cells or cells of another person are implanted in the patient's body after aggressive chemotherapy). Those suffering from haematological cancers may have serious symptoms, and treatments often cause severe and distressing side effects. Living with cancer and undergoing aggressive treatment often leads to physical or psychological health problems such as tiredness, anxiety or depression. Even after having completed the treatment some patients are still affected by their disease and search for alternative treatment options to help them coping with their disease. Meditation Meditation has been practised for thousands of years by many different cultures and has it's origins in ancient eastern traditions. Meditation practice can be done in various postures and ways. For example, the person can focus on breathing in and out, on an object or repeat a word or a pair of words (a mantra). Some sorts of mediation are based on spiritual beliefs. One treatment using meditation practice is called mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy and has shown improvements on distress, quality of life and anxiety in cancer patients. However, there has not been a systematic evaluation on how meditation practice may improve and affect the lives of those with haematologically disease. Objectives We investigated the effects of meditation practice on adult patients with haematological malignancies. Important outcomes were quality of life, overall survival, depression, fatigue, anxiety, quality of sleep and adverse events. We reviewed the effects of meditation practice in addition to standard care for patients newly diagnosed with acute leukaemia compared to standard care only. Findings We included one trial with 91 adult patients, of whom only 42 were analysed. The trial involved five one‐hour meditation intervention sessions between admission and discharge of participants newly diagnosed with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukaemia. There was no information about the age of the participants included in the study. All participants in the trial were hospitalised for initial induction chemotherapy. As the abstract of the publication did not provide numbers, it is not possible to describe the results in more detail. Participants practising meditation reported better physical health and levels of depression could be decreased. Quality of the evidence Most of our pre‐defined outcomes (overall survival, anxiety, fatigue, quality of sleep, and adverse events) were not reported at all. We judge the quality of the evidence for the outcomes quality of life and depression as 'very low', due to high risk of bias (only 42 out 91 participants were evaluated) and very imprecise results. Conclusion There were not enough data available to determine the effectiveness of meditation practice on haematologically‐diseased patients, thus the role of meditation in the treatment of haematological malignancies remains unclear. More high‐quality and larger randomised controlled trials are needed to validate possible positive effects of meditation practice for haematologically‐diseased patients. The evidence is up‐to‐date as of August, 2015.","2016","2019-10-02 22:49:51","2020-04-18 06:36:01","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Adult; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Acute Disease; Depression [therapy]; Hematologic Neoplasms [*psychology]; Leukemia [psychology]; Meditation [*psychology]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discussion centres on the historical context for these exchanges in the two countries, the relationship between the Chinese maritime expeditions and these diplomatic missions, and the reliability of Chinese sources in recording the events and rulers of Bengal. An effort is made to elucidate the many complexities that surrounded this seemingly straightforward event.","2004-04-01","2019-12-18 08:31:11","2020-04-18 08:15:12","2019-12-18 08:31:11","1-37","","1","7","","The Medieval History Journal","The Giraffe of Bengal","","","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Journals","","tex.ids: church_giraffe_2004-1","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\JSV2EBQE\Church - 2004 - The Giraffe of Bengal A Medieval Encounter in Min.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\8HLU6VBK\church_2004_the_giraffe_of_bengal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If so the diagrams can be queried to produce mathematical expressions for causal effects in terms of observed distributions; otherwise, the diagrams can be queried to suggest additional observations or auxiliary experiments from which the desired inferences can be obtained.","","2019-11-14 23:28:16","2019-11-22 04:15:03","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VXQXHHJD\Pearl - Causal diagrams for empirical research.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has demonstrated the benefits of a newer approach to training, that is, error management training, that includes the opportunity to actively explore the task and framing errors as beneficial to learning complex tasks (Keith & Frese, 2008). Other research has highlighted the important role of errors in on-the-job learning in complex domains (Hutchins, 1995). Participants (N = 168) from a large undergraduate university performed a class scheduling task. Results provided support for a hypothesized path model in which error framing influenced cognitive, motivational, and affective factors which in turn differentially affected performance quantity and quality. Within this model, error framing had significant direct effects on metacognition and self-efficacy. Our results suggest that positive error framing can have beneficial effects even when tasks cannot be structured to support extensive exploration. Whereas future research can expand our understanding of error framing effects on outcomes, results from the current study suggest that positive error framing can facilitate learning from errors in real-time performance of tasks.","2014-02","2019-11-22 03:09:05","2020-04-18 07:11:03","","93-111","","1","148","","J Psychol","Error framing effects on performance","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","tex.ids: steele-johnson_error_2014-1 PMID: 24617273","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ZAV6A5VQ\Steele-Johnson and Kalinoski - 2014 - Error framing effects on performance Cognitive, m.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GG4B729U\steele-johnson_kalinoski_2014_error_framing_effects_on_performance.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617273","","Female; Humans; Male; Young Adult; Affect; Cognition; Cues; Inservice Training; Knowledge of Results (Psychology); Learning; Midwestern United States; Models, Psychological; Motivation; Self Efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"B3GGDPNX","blogPost","2016","","Five ways to calculate internal consistency","R-bloggers","","","","https://www.r-bloggers.com/five-ways-to-calculate-internal-consistency/","Let’s get psychometric and learn a range of ways to compute the internal consistency of a test or questionnaire in R. We’ll be covering:    Average inter-item correlation   Average item-total correlation   Cronbach’s alpha   Split-half reliability (adjusted using the Spearman–Brown prophecy formula)   Composite reliability If you’re unfamiliar with any of these, here are some resources to get you up to speed:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha   http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/reltypes.php   http://zencaroline.blogspot.com.au/2007/06/composite-reliability.html  The data For this post, we’ll be using data on a Big 5 measure of personality that is freely available from Personality Tests. You can download the data yourself HERE, or running the following code will handle the downloading and save the data as an object called d:  temp   $ E2 : int  2 2 1 5 1 5 1 3 1 4 ... #__  $ E3 : int  5 3 1 2 3 2 5 5 5 2 ... #__  $ E4 : int  2 3 4 4 3 4 1 3 1 5 ... #__  $ E5 : int  5 3 5 3 3 1 5 5 5 2 ... #__  $ E6 : int  1 3 1 4 1 3 1 1 1 4 ... #__  $ E7 : int  4 1 1 3 3 2 5 4 5 1 ... #__  $ E8 : int  3 5 5 4 1 4 4 3 2 4 ... #__  $ E9 : int  5 1 5 4 3 1 4 4 5 1 ... #__  $ E10: int  1 5 1 5 5 5 1 3 3 5 ...   Here is a list of the extraversion items that people are rating from 1 = Disagree to 5 = Agree:    E1 I am the life of the party.   E2 I don’t talk a lot.   E3 I feel comfortable around people.   E4 I keep in the background.   E5 I start conversations.   E6 I have little to say.   E7 I talk to a lot of different people at parties.   E8 I don’t like to draw attention to myself.   E9 I don’t mind being the center of attention.   E10 I am quiet around strangers. You can see that there are five items that need to be reverse scored (E2, E4, E6, E8, E10). Because ratings range from 1 to 5, we can do the following:  d[, paste0(""E"", c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10))] % correlate() #__ # A tibble: 10 x 11 #__    rowname        E1        E2        E3        E4        E5        E6 #__                                     #__ 1       E1        NA 0.4528892 0.5002331 0.5237516 0.5378563 0.3657830 #__ 2       E2 0.4528892        NA 0.4792026 0.5549109 0.5916995 0.5694593 #__ 3       E3 0.5002331 0.4792026        NA 0.4930294 0.6161848 0.3296186 #__ 4       E4 0.5237516 0.5549109 0.4930294        NA 0.5123502 0.4714739 #__ 5       E5 0.5378563 0.5916995 0.6161848 0.5123502        NA 0.4996636 #__ 6       E6 0.3657830 0.5694593 0.3296186 0.4714739 0.4996636        NA #__ 7       E7 0.6360617 0.4731673 0.5684515 0.4999339 0.6205428 0.3725773 #__ 8       E8 0.4498123 0.3791802 0.4177098 0.4505763 0.3850780 0.3310247 #__ 9       E9 0.5280366 0.3958574 0.4753085 0.4631383 0.4851778 0.3280024 #__ 10     E10 0.4908861 0.4487868 0.5000737 0.5234228 0.5525188 0.4137737 #__ # ... with 4 more variables: E7 , E8 , E9 , E10    Because the diagonal is already set to NA, we can obtain the average correlation of each item with all others by computing the means for each column (excluding the rowname column):  inter_item % correlate() %__% select(-rowname) %__% colMeans(na.rm = TRUE) inter_item #__        E1        E2        E3        E4        E5        E6        E7  #__ 0.4983678 0.4827948 0.4866458 0.4991764 0.5334524 0.4090418 0.5133091  #__        E8        E9       E10  #__ 0.4270190 0.4731896 0.4814496   Aside, note that select() comes from the dplyr package, which is imported when you use corrr.  We can see that E5 and E7 are more strongly correlated with the other items on average than E8. However, most items correlate with the others in a reasonably restricted range around .4 to .5.  To obtain the overall average inter-item correlation, we calculate the mean() of these values:  mean(inter_item) #__ [1] 0.4804446   However, with these values, we can explore a range of attributes about the relationships between the items. For example, we can visualise them in a histogram and highlight the mean as follows:  library(ggplot2)  data.frame(inter_item) %__%    ggplot(aes(x = inter_item)) +     geom_histogram(bins = 10, alpha = .5) +     geom_vline(xintercept = mean(inter_item), color = ""red"") +     xlab(""Mean inter-item correlation"") +     theme_bw()     Average item-total correlation We can investigate the average item-total correlation in a similar way to the inter-item correlations. The first thing we need to do is calculate the total score. Let’s say that a person’s score is the mean of their responses to all ten items:  d$score    E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10 score #__ 1  4  4  5  4  5  5  4  3  5   5   4.4 #__ 2  2  4  3  3  3  3  1  1  1   1   2.2 #__ 3  5  5  1  2  5  5  1  1  5   5   3.5 #__ 4  2  1  2  2  3  2  3  2  4   1   2.2 #__ 5  3  5  3  3  3  5  3  5  3   1   3.4 #__ 6  1  1  2  2  1  3  2  2  1   1   1.6   Now, we’ll correlate() everything again, but this time focus() on the correlations of the score with the items:  item_total % correlate() %__% focus(score) item_total #__ # A tibble: 10 x 2 #__    rowname     score #__            #__ 1       E1 0.7520849 #__ 2       E2 0.7297506 #__ 3       E3 0.7350644 #__ 4       E4 0.7485092 #__ 5       E5 0.7945943 #__ 6       E6 0.6367799 #__ 7       E7 0.7768180 #__ 8       E8 0.6640914 #__ 9       E9 0.7273987 #__ 10     E10 0.7306038   Again, we can calculate their mean as:  mean(item_total$score) #__ [1] 0.7295695   And we can plot the results:  item_total %__%    ggplot(aes(x = score)) +     geom_histogram(bins = 10, alpha = .5) +     geom_vline(xintercept = mean(item_total$score), color = ""red"") +     xlab(""Mean item-total correlation"") +     theme_bw()     Cronbach’s alpha Cronbach’s alpha is one of the most widely reported measures of internal consistency. Although it’s possible to implement the maths behind it, I’m lazy and like to use the alpha() function from the psych package.

Also note that we get “the average interitem correlation”, average_r, and various versions of “the correlation of each item with the total score” such as raw.r, whose values match our earlier calculations.  If you’d like to access the alpha value itself, you can do the following:  psych::alpha(d)$total$std.alpha #__ [1] 0.9024126   Split-half reliability (adjusted using the Spearman–Brown prophecy formula) There are times when we can’t calculate internal consistency using item responses. For example, I often work with a decision-making variable called recklessness. This variable is calculated after people answer questions (e.g., “What is the longest river is Asia”), and then decide whether or not to bet on their answer being correct. Recklessness is calculated as the proportion of incorrect answers that a person bets on.  If you think about it, it’s not possible to calculate internal consistency for this variable using any of the above measures. The reason for this is that the items that contribute to two people’s recklessness scores could be completely different. One person could give incorrect answers on questions 1 to 5 (thus these questions go into calculating their score), while another person might incorrectly respond to questions 6 to 10. Thus, calculating recklessness for many individuals isn’t as simple as summing across items. Instead, we need an item pool from which to pull different combinations of questions for each person.  To overcome this sort of issue, an appropriate method for calculating internal consistency is to use a split-half reliability. This entails splitting your test items in half (e.g., into odd and even) and calculating your variable for each person with each half. For example, I typically calculate recklessness for each participant from odd items and then from even items. These scores are then correlated and adjusted using the Spearman-Brown prophecy/prediction formula (for examples, see some of my publications such as this or this). Similar to Cronbach’s alpha, a value closer to 1 and further from zero indicates greater internal consistency.  We can still calculate split-half reliability for variables that do not have this problem! So let’s do this with our extraversion data as follows:  # Calculating total score... score_e","2016-08-26","2019-11-21 23:43:18","2019-11-21 23:43:18","2019-11-21 23:43:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LFZTKWEX\five-ways-to-calculate-internal-consistency.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, once one has algebraically identified effect modifiers, the DAG implies a role for them. The limitations of epidemiologic definitions of “effect modification” are discussed, along with the implications of scale dependency for assessing interactions, where the scale can be either absolute risk, relative risk, or odds. My view is that probabilistic independence leads to the log-complement as a natural scale for interaction, but even that scale does not necessarily admit unambiguous inference. Any 2 direct causes of D are effect modifiers for each other on at least 2 scales, which can make a reasonable person question the utility of the concept. Still, etiologic models for joint effects are important, because most diseases arise through pathways involving multiple factors. I suggest an enhancement in construction of DAGs in epidemiology that includes arrow-on-arrow representations for effect modification. Examples are given, some of which depend on scale and some of which do not. An example illustrates possible biologic implications for such an effect modification DAG.","2007-09","2019-11-20 21:49:56","2019-11-20 21:50:11","2019-11-20 21:49:56","569","","5","18","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6ICGVJJ8\articleviewer.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\UFI38SQW\Weinberg - 2007 - Can DAGs Clarify Effect Modification.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6DMWKJCS\weinberg_2007_can_dags_clarify_effect_modification.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects (“selection bias”) and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome (“confounding”).

Such new data challenge traditional boundaries between quantitative and qualitative research, and exciting horizons have emerged. New analytic approaches are warranted, however, given the typically unstructured, respondent-generated format of such data. In this article, I examine how sociologists have handled text data prior to digitization. Building on recent advancements in computational linguistics and computational social science, I then offer a network-based model and approach for analyzing similarities and locating emergent, general themes in digitized text. I provide a case in point by analyzing the United States’ presidential inaugural addresses. This analysis illustrates how sociologists can take advantage of both the breadth of new digital sources of data and the richness that such qualitative material provides. Indeed, the digitization of texts represents a possible and stimulating sea change in how we tell socio-cultural and historical stories.

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.","2018-01","2019-11-08 09:18:30","2019-11-08 09:18:30","2019-11-08 09:18:29","","","138","15","","J R Soc Interface","The Markov blankets of life","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 29343629 PMCID: PMC5805980","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\CKJUD4N2\Kirchhoff et al. - 2018 - The Markov blankets of life autonomy, active infe.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5805980/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the development of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), designing powerful and robust computational method for identifying epistatic interactions associated with common diseases becomes a great challenge to bioinformatics society, because the study of epistatic interactions often deals with the large size of the genotyped data and the huge amount of combinations of all the possible genetic factors. Most existing computational detection methods are based on the classification capacity of SNP sets, which may fail to identify SNP sets that are strongly associated with the diseases and introduce a lot of false positives. In addition, most methods are not suitable for genome-wide scale studies due to their computational complexity. Results We propose a new Markov Blanket-based method, DASSO-MB (Detection of ASSOciations using Markov Blanket) to detect epistatic interactions in case-control GWAS. Markov blanket of a target variable T can completely shield T from all other variables. Thus, we can guarantee that the SNP set detected by DASSO-MB has a strong association with diseases and contains fewest false positives. Furthermore, DASSO-MB uses a heuristic search strategy by calculating the association between variables to avoid the time-consuming training process as in other machine-learning methods. We apply our algorithm to simulated datasets and a real case-control dataset. We compare DASSO-MB to other commonly-used methods and show that our method significantly outperforms other methods and is capable of finding SNPs strongly associated with diseases. Conclusions Our study shows that DASSO-MB can identify a minimal set of causal SNPs associated with diseases, which contains less false positives compared to other existing methods. Given the huge size of genomic dataset produced by GWAS, this is critical in saving the potential costs of biological experiments and being an efficient guideline for pathogenesis research.","2010-04-29","2019-11-08 09:14:16","2019-11-08 09:14:16","2019-11-08 09:14:16","S5","","Suppl 3","11","","BMC Bioinformatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20438652 PMCID: PMC2863064","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GRJU4ZBF\Han et al. - 2010 - A Markov blanket-based method for detecting causal.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863064/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we explored whether initiating home-based primary care in a frail homebound cohort, influenced hospital use. Second, we explored whether initiating regular home care support for personal care with usual primary care, in a second somewhat less frail cohort, influenced hospital use. METHODS: This was a before-after retrospective cohort study of two frail populations in Vancouver, Canada using administrative data to assess the influence of two different services started in two different cohorts over the same time period. The participants were 246 recipients of integrated home-based primary care and 492 recipients of home care followed between July 1st, 2008 and June 30th, 2013 before and after starting their respective services. Individuals in each group were linked to their hospital emergency department visit and discharge abstract records. The main outcome measures were mean emergency department visit and hospital admission rates per 1000 patient days for 21 months before versus the period after receipt of services, and the adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) on these outcomes post receipt of service. RESULTS: Before versus after starting integrated home-based primary care, emergency department visit rates per 1000 patient days (95% confidence intervals) were 4.1 (3.8, 4.4) versus 3.7 (3.3, 4.1), and hospital admissions rates were 2.3 (2.1, 2.5) versus 2.2 (1.9, 2.5). Before versus after starting home care, emergency department visit rates per 1000 patient days (95% confidence intervals) were 3.0 (2.8, 3.2) versus 4.0 (3.7, 4.3) visits and hospital admissions rates were 1.3 (1.2, 1.4) versus 1.9 (1.7, 2.1). Home-based primary care IRRs were 0.91 (0.72, 1.15) and 0.99 (0.76, 1.27) and home care IRRs were 1.34 (1.15, 1.56) and 1.46 (1.22, 1.74) for emergency department visits and hospital admissions respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After enrollment in integrated home-based primary care, emergency department visit and hospital admission rates stabilized. After starting home care with usual primary care, emergency department visit and hospital admission rates continued to rise.","2018","2019-11-08 03:08:55","2019-11-08 03:08:55","","248","","1","18","","BMC Health Serv Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29622006 PMCID: PMC5887263","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6F34RR8S\mcgregor_et_al_2018_a_before-after_study_of_hospital_use_in_two_frail_populations_receiving.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29622006","","Female; Humans; Male; Aged; British Columbia; Aged, 80 and over; Community medicine; Controlled Before-After Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Facilities and Services Utilization; Family practice/general practice/primary care; Frail Elderly; Geriatric medicine/care of the elderly; Home Care Services; Homecare; Hospitalization; Hospitals; House Calls; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Discharge; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agents that were suggested to have a role in human diseases have been tested in animals to firmly establish a causative link. Bacterial pathogens are perhaps the oldest examples, and tobacco smoke and lung cancer and asbestos and mesothelioma provide two more recent examples. With the advent of toxicity testing guidelines and protocols, toxicology took on a role that was intended to anticipate or predict potential adverse effects in humans, and epidemiology, in many cases, served a role in verifying or negating these toxicological predictions. The coupled role of epidemiology and toxicology in discerning human health effects by environmental agents is obvious, but there is currently no systematic and transparent way to bring the data and analysis of the two disciplines together in a way that provides a unified view on an adverse causal relationship between an agent and a disease. In working to advance the interaction between the fields of toxicology and epidemiology, we propose here a five-step ""Epid-Tox"" process that would focus on: (1) collection of all relevant studies, (2) assessment of their quality, (3) evaluation of the weight of evidence, (4) assignment of a scalable conclusion, and (5) placement on a causal relationship grid. The causal relationship grid provides a clear view of how epidemiological and toxicological data intersect, permits straightforward conclusions with regard to a causal relationship between agent and effect, and can show how additional data can influence conclusions of causality.","2011-08","2019-11-08 02:49:53","2019-11-08 02:49:53","","223-234","","2","122","","Toxicol.

The causal pie model has fulfilled this role in epidemiology and could be of similar value in evolutionary biology and ecology. In the causal pie model, outcomes result from sufficient causes. Each sufficient cause is made up of a ""causal pie"" of ""component causes"". Several different causal pies may exist for the same outcome. If and only if all component causes of a sufficient cause are present, that is, a causal pie is complete, does the outcome occur. The effect of a component cause hence depends on the presence of the other component causes that constitute some causal pie. Because all component causes are equally and fully causative for the outcome, the sum of causes for some outcome exceeds 100%. The causal pie model provides a way of thinking that maps into a number of recurrent themes in evolutionary biology and ecology: It charts when component causes have an effect and are subject to natural selection, and how component causes affect selection on other component causes; which partitions of outcomes with respect to causes are feasible and useful; and how to view the composition of a(n apparently homogeneous) population. The diversity of specific results that is directly understood from the causal pie model is a test for both the validity and the applicability of the model. The causal pie model provides a common language in which results across disciplines can be communicated and serves as a template along which future causal analyses can be made.","2014-05","2019-11-08 02:49:53","2019-11-08 02:49:53","","1924-1930","","10","4","","Ecol Evol","The causal pie model","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24963386 PMCID: PMC4063485","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DDEXGSAI\wensink_et_al_2014_the_causal_pie_model.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963386","","Agents of selection; aging; causation; causes of mortality; correlated traits; natural selection; semi-neutral mutations; trade-offs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-monotonic exposure-response relations in a large population may lack aggregate consistency, strength, biological gradient, and other hallmarks of traditional causal relations. For example, a u-shaped or n-shaped curve may exhibit zero correlation between dose and response. Thus, possible hormesis requires new ways to detect potentially causal exposure-response relations. This paper introduces information-theoretic criteria for identifying potential causality in epidemiological data that may contain nonmonotonic or threshold dose-response nonlinearities. Roughly, exposure variable X is a potential cause of response variable Y if and only if: (a) X is INFORMATIVE about Y (i.e., the mutual information between X and Y, I(X; Y), measured in bits, is positive. This provides the required generalization of statistical association measures for monotonic relations); (b) UNCONFOUNDED: X provides information about Y that cannot be removed by conditioning on other variables. (c) PREDICTIVE: Past values of X are informative about future values of Y, even after conditioning on past values of Y; (d) CAUSAL ORDERING: Y is conditionally independent of the parents of X, given X. These criteria yield practical algorithms for detecting potential causation in cohort, case-control, and time series data sets. We illustrate them by identifying potential causes of campylobacteriosis, a foodborne bacterial infectious diarrheal illness, in a recent case-control data set. In contrast to previous analyses, our information-theoretic approach identifies a hitherto unnoticed, highly statistically significant, hormetic (U-shaped) relation between recent fast food consumption and women's risk of campylobacteriosis. We also discuss the application of the new information-theoretic criteria in resolving ambiguities and apparent contradictions due to confounding and information redundancy or overlap among variables in epidemiological data sets.","2006-08-19","2019-11-08 02:49:53","2019-11-08 02:49:53","","119-132","","2","4","","Dose Response","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 18648583 PMCID: PMC2477674","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\IE5WRGPR\cox_2006_detecting_causal_nonlinear_exposure-response_relations_in_epidemiological_data.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18648583","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Practical violations of this assumption frequently occur in data analysis when certain exposures are rarely observed within some strata of the population. The inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) estimator is particularly sensitive to violations of this assumption; however, we demonstrate that this is a problem for all estimators of causal effects. This is due to the fact that the ETA assumption is about information (or lack thereof) in the data. A new class of causal models, causal models for realistic individualized exposure rules (CMRIER), is based on dynamic interventions. CMRIER generalize MSM, and their parameters remain fully identifiable from the observed data, even when the ETA assumption is violated, if the dynamic interventions are set to be realistic. Examples of such realistic interventions are provided. We argue that causal effects defined by CMRIER may be more appropriate in many situations, particularly those with policy considerations. Through simulation studies, we examine the performance of the IPTW estimator of the CMRIER parameters in contrast to that of the MSM parameters. We also apply the methodology to a real data analysis in air pollution epidemiology to illustrate the interpretation of the causal effects defined by CMRIER.","2012-06-15","2019-11-08 02:49:53","2019-11-08 02:49:53","","1380-1404","","13","31","","Stat Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22362629 PMCID: PMC4113478","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6XSYA78X\moore_et_al_2012_causal_inference_in_epidemiological_studies_with_strong_confounding.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22362629","","Air Pollution; Humans; Epidemiologic Studies; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Data Interpretation, Statistical; Asthma; Models, Statistical; Ozone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How well studies apply and report the elements of causal mediation analysis remains unknown. METHODS: We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies published in 2015 that employed causal mediation analysis to estimate direct and indirect effects of observed associations between an exposure on an outcome. We identified potential epidemiological studies through conducting a citation search within Web of Science and a keyword search within PubMed. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility. For eligible studies, one reviewer performed data extraction, and a senior epidemiologist confirmed the extracted information. Empirical application and methodological details of the technique were extracted and summarized. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eligible for data extraction. While the majority of studies reported and identified the effects of measures, most studies lacked sufficient details on the extent to which identifiability assumptions were satisfied. Although most studies addressed issues of unmeasured confounders either from empirical approaches or sensitivity analyses, the majority did not examine the potential bias arising from the measurement error of the mediator. Some studies allowed for exposure-mediator interaction and only a few presented results from models both with and without interactions. Power calculations were scarce. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of causal mediation analysis is varied and suboptimal. Given that the application of causal mediation analysis will likely continue to increase, developing standards of reporting of causal mediation analysis in epidemiological research would be prudent.","2016-07-20","2019-11-08 02:49:53","2019-11-08 02:49:53","","354","","","9","","BMC Res Notes","Implementation and reporting of causal mediation analysis in 2015","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27439301 PMCID: PMC4955118","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\N5H3R52E\liu_et_al_2016_implementation_and_reporting_of_causal_mediation_analysis_in_2015.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439301","","Humans; Bias; Causality; Epidemiologic Studies; Causal inference; Models, Statistical; Causal mediation analysis; Systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first is to try to account for the failure of these two sub-disciplines to achieve any deepening engagement with each other, despite the long-expressed desirability of that goal; the second is to draw attention to the scope for enriching the sociology of the life course through Erik Erikson’s model of life span development; and the last is the potential for linking Eriksonian theory with current debates within mainstream sociology about the processes involved in ‘individualisation’ and ‘self-reflexivity’ as an alternative entry point to bring together these two fields of work.","2016-04","2020-01-26 22:26:55","2020-01-26 22:26:55","2020-01-26 22:26:55","301-315","","2","50","","Sociology","Connecting Life Span Development with the Sociology of the Life Course","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ZILYBNST\Gilleard and Higgs - 2016 - Connecting Life Span Development with the Sociolog.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper treats a particular problem of generalizability, called “transportability,” deﬁned as a license to transfer causal effects learned in experimental studies to a new population, in which only observational studies can be conducted. We introduce a formal representation called “selection diagrams” for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between populations of interest and, using this representation, we reduce questions of transportability to symbolic derivations in the docalculus. This reduction yields graph-based procedures for deciding, prior to observing any data, whether causal effects in the target population can be inferred from experimental ﬁndings in the study population. When the answer is afﬁrmative, the procedures identify what experimental and observational ﬁndings need be obtained from the two populations, and how they can be combined to ensure bias-free transport.","2014-11","2020-02-01 19:58:00","2020-04-18 07:27:45","2020-02-01 19:58:00","579-595","","4","29","","Statist.

Using interviews (N = 24) and observations, the programme theory of the intervention and to what extent the intervention had been implemented were assessed. Using survey data (N = 238), repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to test for differences in the development of job insecurity between the intervention group and a comparison group.

Strategies such as mindfulness and positive psychology, linked with deep breathing, have been shown to increase resiliency. We hypothesized that education about the neuroscience literature, coupled with teaching about well-being using short, easy-to-practice evidence-based exercises, would increase acceptance of this curriculum among residents and that providing protected time to practice these exercises would help trainees incorporate them into their daily lives. Methods Residents were asked to attend a 60-minute didactic featuring both the concepts and science behind well-being. Residents then attended 15-minute booster sessions during protected didactic time each week for a 12-week curriculum. The booster sessions were peer-led by wellness champions. Additionally, there were monthly competitions using free phone apps to promote physical fitness through steps and flights challenges. Results The 12-week curriculum was offered to 272 residents across five subspecialties of internal medicine, general surgery, anesthesiology, psychiatry, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. A total of 188 residents (69%) participated in the initial didactic component. The curriculum was positively received, with four of the five residency programs participating in weekly sessions. Residents in four participating departments then chose to continue the weekly sessions on a voluntary basis after the initial 12-week curriculum. Discussion It is feasible to implement a low-cost, peer-led wellness curriculum to educate residents and foster an environment during residency training where mindfulness, optimism, gratitude, and social connectedness are the norm.","","2020-02-22 04:53:07","2020-02-26 01:50:16","2020-02-22 04:53:07","","","","13","","MedEdPORTAL","Resident Wellness","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 30800852 PMCID: PMC6338253","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\WRHC9WXX\Aggarwal et al. - Resident Wellness An Intervention to Decrease Bur.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6338253/","excluded; wellness programmes; medical trainees; well-being educational intervention; hospital setting; feasiblity study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perceived stress, burnout, emotional and psychological well-being, mindfulness, and productivity were measured at baseline, weeks 8 and 16, and 1 year. Results: Online usage was low with participants favoring CD use and group practice. All active groups demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and increases in emotional and psychological well-being compared with control.

This study investigates the effect of physical exercise on social capital at work. Methods: Altogether, 200 female healthcare workers (nurses and nurse’s aides) from 18 departments at three hospitals were randomly allocated at the department level to 10 weeks of (1) group-based physical exercise at work during working hours or (2) physical exercise at home during leisure time. At baseline and follow-up, participants replied to a questionnaire concerning workplace social capital: (1) within teams (bonding); (2) between teams (bridging); (3) between teams and nearest leaders (linking A); (4) between teams and distant leaders (linking B). Results: At baseline, bonding, bridging, linking A and linking B social capital were 74 (SD 17), 61 (SD 19), 72 (SD 22) and 70 (SD 18), respectively, on a scale of 0–100 (where 100 is best). A group by time interaction was found for bonding social capital (P=0.02), where physical exercise at work compared with physical exercise during leisure time increased 5.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3– 8.2)(effect size, Cohen’s d = 0.31) from baseline to follow-up. For physical exercise at home during leisure time and exercise at work combined, a time effect (P=0.001) was found for linking A social capital, with a decrease of 4.8 (95% confidence interval 1.9–7.6). Conclusions: Group-based physical exercise at work contributed to building social capital within teams at the workplace. However, the general decrease of social capital between teams and nearest leaders during the intervention period warrants further research.","2015-12-01","2020-02-24 00:43:22","2020-02-26 08:15:43","2020-02-24 00:43:22","810-818","","8","43","","Scand J Public Health","Effect of physical exercise on workplace social capital","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\YTKLYLM4\Andersen et al. - 2015 - Effect of physical exercise on workplace social ca.pdf","","RCT; included","nursing; human capital; occupational; physical activity; randomized trial; Social capital; well-being; work-related","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The changes in the intervention group with regard to job strain, effortreward imbalance, exhaustion, sleep and recovery were not statistically different from changes in the control group. For the non-exhausted employees though, reward was significantly higher at follow up compared to baseline, but only in the intervention group. An important piece of information is that the objective workload was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group throughout the study. Not all the components of the intervention were implemented as intended. Context and process information, such as objective data and implementation fidelity are necessary for a valid interpretation of the results.","2018-03-04","2020-02-24 00:51:24","2020-02-27 22:18:18","2020-02-24 00:51:24","219-234","","2","27","","European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\UNU4WJU2\Arapovic-Johansson et al. - 2018 - Participatory work place intervention for stress p.pdf","","RCT; included; stress; Participatory workpace intervention; organisational intervention; Job strain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental practice (MP) is a strategy used in other high-performance industries to alleviate anxiety. This study investigated if MP reduces stress in novice surgeons. Study Design A prospective, randomized controlled design was used with 20 novice surgeons recruited by random sampling. After baseline testing, participants underwent training on an evidence-based virtual reality (VR) curriculum. They then performed 5 VR laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) after being randomized to MP or control groups. The MP group performed 30 minutes of MP using a validated MP training protocol before each LC; control participants conducted an unrelated activity. Stress was assessed subjectively using the validated State-Trait Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and objectively with a continuous heart rate (HR) monitor and salivary cortisol. Mental imagery was assessed using the validated mental imagery questionnaire. Results Eighteen participants completed the study. There were no intergroup differences in baseline stress, imagery, or technical ability. Comparing the MP group with controls, subjective stress (STAI) was lower for the MP group (median 8.40 vs 11.31, p < 0.01). Objective stress was also significantly reduced for the MP group in terms of the average HR (median 72 vs 88 beats/minute, p < 0.0001), maximum HR (median 102 vs 119 beats/minute, p < 0.01), and cortisol (median 2.26 vs 3.85 nmol/L, p < 0.05). Significant negative correlations were obtained between stress and imagery, indicating that improved imagery was associated with lower stress (p < 0.05). Conclusions A short period of MP reduces the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine response to stress on a VR simulator. Additional research should determine whether this effect extends beyond novice surgeons and transfers to the operating room.","2011-02-01","2020-02-24 00:59:00","2020-02-27 22:20:34","2020-02-24 00:59:00","225-233","","2","212","","Journal of the American College of Surgeons","Mental Practice","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3W7PTUEL\Arora et al. - 2011 - Mental Practice Effective Stress Management Train.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\AHGQ46ZD\S1072751510010951.html","","hospital setting; RCT; included; Surgeons; Trainee surgeons; mental practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A randomised and controlled study in employee-volunteers (with Perceived Stress Scale [PSS-14]>22) was performed to assess a mindfulness program based on brief integrated mindfulness practices (M-PBI) with the aim of reducing stress in the workplace. The PSS-14 of the employees before and after 8-weeks M-PBI program, as well as after a 20-week follow-up, was assessed (primary endpoint). The employees also carried the following questionnaires (secondary endpoints): Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Experiences Questionnaire-Decentering (EQ-D), and Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS). Heart Rate Variability (HRV) was measured during each session in a subgroup of employees (n = 10) of the interventional group randomly selected. A total of 40 employees (77.5% female median [SD] age of 36.6 [5.6] years) took part in this study: 21 and 19 in the intervention and control group, respectively. No differences in baseline characteristics were encountered between the groups. Results show a significant decrease in stress and increase in mindfulness over time in the intervention group (PSS-14 and FFMQ; p < 0.05 both). Additionally, an improvement in decentering (EQ-D), self-compassion (SCS) and burnout (MBI-GS) were also observed compared to the control group (p < 0.05 in all).

Moreover, mediational pathways were examined. Methods: A longitudinal, quasi-experimental trial was evaluated in Belgian employees. The intervention group (IG: n = 246) received 3-months individualized, tailored PA counseling, consisting of face-to-face counseling and follow-up e-mail and telephone contacts. The reference group (n = 54) received no PA counseling. Outcome measures (assessed at baseline, 3 mo [short term], and 9 mo [long term]) included body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, well-being, and step-based PA. Results: With no changes in the reference group, the IG showed short-term improvements in body mass index (−0.24 kg/m2, P <.001), body fat (−0.88%, P <.001), waist circumference (−1.47 cm, P <.001), and muscle percentage (+0.47%, P <.001). Moreover, with respect to cardiorespiratory fitness, IG participants improved on perceived exertion, both in the short term (−0.91, P <.001) and long term (−0.83, P <.001). Furthermore, perceived physical well-being increased in the IG, both in the short term (+0.57, P <.001) and long term (+0.57, P <.001). The observed intervention effects on body composition, perceived exertion, and well-being were mediated by (increases in) step-based PA. Conclusions: Workplace PA counseling programs have the potential to enhance employees' health-related fitness and well-being. Importantly, step-based PA behavior change was found to contribute to the postintervention improvements.

Process evaluation was conducted to study the implementation process and to use this knowledge to understand the results. Methods: Seven intervention units (n = 128) and seven non-randomized reference units (n = 103) of a large hospital in Denmark participated in an intervention project with the goal of improving the psychosocial working conditions. The intervention consisted of discussion days for all staff, employee working groups, leader coaching, and activities to improve communication and cooperation. Measures of the psychosocial work environment were conducted before the start of the intervention and again after 16 months using 13 scales from the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, version I (COPSOQ I). Results: In the intervention units there was a statistically significant worsening in six out of 13 work environment scales. The decrease was most pronounced for three scales that measure aspects of interpersonal relations and leadership. In addition, all three scales that measure aspects of work organization and job content decreased. In comparison, the reference group showed statistically significant changes in only two scales. Process evaluation revealed that a large part of the implementation failed and that different implicit theories were at play. Conclusions: Without the insights gained from process data the negative effects of this intervention could not be understood.

Intervention Medical Yoga in nine weekly sessions led by a certified instructor, as well as an instruction film to be followed at home twice weekly.

Eligibility was perfect, but only 40% of workers were willing to participate. The subjects adhered to a great extent to the intervention and answered the questionnaires satisfactorily. Reaching target individuals requires careful attention to informing participants. The intervention showed no significant effects on stress and work ability, though the two measures correlated significantly over time. Conclusion Factors limiting feasibility of this workplace intervention were identified. Work place interventions may need to be sanctioned at a higher managerial level. The optimal time, length and availability of the workplace intervention should be explored further.

The replacement of traditional home-cooked meals with ready-to-eat, processed foods has contributed to an increased risk of chronic diseases in urban Indians. Improving the nutrition of Indians by promoting healthy food consumption in early life and in adolescence would help to reduce these health risks. However, little is known about the quality and quantity of foods and beverages consumed by urban Indian adolescents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the food consumption patterns in a sample of urban Indian adolescents. Methods: A self-administered, semi-quantitative, 59-item meal-based food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to assess the dietary intake of adolescents over the previous day. A total of 1026 students (aged 14–16 years) attending private, English-speaking schools in Kolkata, India completed the survey. Results: Overall, the adolescents reported poor dietary intakes; over one quarter (30%) reported no consumption of vegetables and 70% reported eating three or more servings of energy-dense snacks, on the previous day. Nearly half of the respondents (45%) did not consume any servings of fruits and 47% reported drinking three or more servings of energy-dense beverages. The mean consumption of food groups in serves/day varied from 0.88 (SD = 1.36) for pulses and legumes to 6.25 (SD = 7.22) for energy-dense snacks. In general, girls had more nutritious dietary intakes than boys. Conclusions: The Indian adolescents reported poor food consumption patterns, and these findings highlight the need to design effective nutrition promotion strategies to encourage healthy eating in adolescence and targeting food supply and availability.","2017-12","2020-02-25 00:27:43","2020-02-25 00:27:43","2020-02-25 00:27:43","50","","1","16","","Nutr J","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\2BZH8FAY\Rathi et al. - 2017 - Food consumption patterns of adolescents aged 14–1.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Healthy eating and being physically active are particularly important for children and adolescents. This is because their nutrition and lifestyle influence their wellbeing, growth and development. There remains considerable room for improvement in the diets of British schoolchildren, according to findings of the government’s National Diet and Nutrition Surveys (NDNS), but some improvements have been made in the past decade. Although intakes of saturated fatty acids and non-milk extrinsic sugars have decreased in recent years, on average, they are still above recommended upper levels. Average contribution of fat to total energy intake has dropped below the recommended upper level of 35%, but fibre intakes remain low. With regard to micronutrients, many teenage girls are consum- ing low amounts of iron, but there is also evidence of low intakes of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, magnesium, potassium, selenium, iodine and zinc. New data on micronutrient status is now available for 11–18 year-olds, and reveals low levels of vitamin D, riboflavin and iron (mainly in girls). Low vitamin D intake and status is a particular problem in some ethnic minority groups, especially South Asian chil- dren. There is also some evidence of socio-economic inequalities; for example, children from families with higher incomes tend to have higher intakes of fruits and vegetables compared with children from families with lower incomes. This paper also discusses how dietary patterns can influence the micronutrient intake and status of schoolchildren, as well as the risk of overweight and obesity.","2014","2020-02-25 00:43:27","2020-07-09 01:33:23","2020-02-25 00:43:27","9-73","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.ids: noauthor_diet_nodate-2","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\WX2NAJRT\Diet, nutrition and schoolchildren An update - We.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6TVJGWWU\nbu.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\74D7558S\nbu.html","","diet; nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess agreement with the NLAI by survey participants, we used the following scale: “necessary” (70% agreement), “adequate” (80% agreement), or “good” (90% agreement); comments were analyzed by using content analysis. For the pilot, we made comparisons between subjective assessments, the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), and the NLAI. Registered dietitians also completed a postpilot–study survey. Results For the online survey, we found good agreement (average, 89.7%) for including each section of the NLAI. All sections accomplished their purpose (average, 81.5%). For the pilot, REALM and NLAI correlation (r = 0.38) was not significant; the subjective assessment of clients by dietitians and NLAI lacked agreement 44% of the time, and registered dietitians provided instruction on deficient knowledge and skills identified by the NLAI 90% of the time.

Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as “unconscious”. An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jhāna meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jhāna consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness.</p><p>This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jhāna meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and “present” in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display “spindle” activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.</p>","2019-01-15","2020-01-19 05:26:49","2020-01-19 05:26:49","2020-01-19 05:26:49","407544","","","","","","The human default consciousness and its disruption","","","","","","","en","© 2019, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Guilds provided an organizational mechanism for groups of businessmen to negotiate with political elites for exclusive legal privileges that allowed them to reap monopoly rents. Guild members then used their guilds to redirect a share of these rents to political elites in return for support and enforcement. In short, guilds enabled their members and political elites to negotiate a way of extracting rents in the manufacturing and commercial sectors, rents that neither party could have extracted on its own. First, I provide an overview of where and when European guilds arose, what occupations they encompassed, how large they were, and how they varied across time and space. I then examine how guild activities affected market competition, commercial security, contract enforcement, product quality, human capital, and technological innovation. The historical findings on guilds provide strong support for the view that institutions arise and survive for centuries not because they are efficient but because they serve the distributional interests of powerful groups.","2014-11","2019-12-25 08:51:40","2019-12-25 08:51:40","2019-12-25 08:51:40","169-192","","4","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.aeaweb.org","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\BUQJ4YSS\ogilvie_2014_the_economics_of_guilds.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\2757RPAB\articles.html","","","Contracts and Reputation; Institutions: Design, Formation, Operations, and Impact, Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior, Transactional Relationships; Intellectual Property Rights: General; Networks, Firm Organization and Market Structure, Economic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: General, International, or Comparative, Innovation; Research and Development; Technological Change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this quasi-experimental study, we evaluate the effect of a living wage intervention on depressive symptoms of apparel factory workers in the Dominican Republic. Setting Two apparel factories in the Dominican Republic. Participants The final sample consisted of 204 hourly wage workers from the intervention (99) and comparison (105) factories. Interventions In 2010, an apparel factory began a living wage intervention including a 350% wage increase and significant workplace improvements. The wage increase was plausibly exogenous because workers were not aware of the living wage when applying for jobs and expected to be paid the usual minimum wage. These individuals were compared with workers at a similar local factory paying minimum wage, 15–16 months postintervention. Primary outcome measures Workers’ depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Ordinary least squares and Poisson regressions were used to evaluate treatment effect of the intervention, adjusted for covariates. Results Intervention factory workers had fewer depressive symptoms than comparison factory workers (unadjusted mean CES-D scores: 10.6±9.3 vs 14.7±11.6, p=0.007). These results were sustained when controlling for covariates (β=−5.4, 95% CI −8.5 to −2.3, p=0.001). In adjusted analyses using the standard CES-D clinical cut-off of 16, workers at the intervention factory had a 47% reduced risk of clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms compared with workers at the comparison factory (23% vs 40%). Conclusions Policymakers have long grappled with how best to improve mental health among populations in low-income and middle-income countries. We find that providing a living wage and workplace improvements to improve income and well-being in a disadvantaged population is associated with reduced depressive symptoms.","2015-08-01","2020-02-29 09:55:39","2020-03-01 08:10:14","2020-02-29 09:55:39","e007336","","8","5","","","Impact of a private sector living wage intervention on depressive symptoms among apparel workers in the Dominican Republic","","","","","","","en","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This programme was used to investigate the short-term effect of regular sports team participation on individual employee and organisational health. Methods: A large services organisation participated in this study. Two regional worksites of office workers were assigned as the team sport (intervention) (n = 28 participants) or control (n = 20 participants) groups. The team sport sessions were underpinned by psychological behaviour change theory and consisted of weekly 1-h team sport sessions for 12 weeks. Measures of aerobic fitness, physical activity behaviour, group cohesion, interaction and communication, psychological wellbeing, health, anthropometrics and workplace experiences were recorded preand post-intervention. Data were analysed using a series of mixed ANOVAs. Results: After 12 weeks significant improvements were observed in VO2 max (+ 4.5 ± 5.8 ml/min kg, P < .002, η2p = . 182), interpersonal communication within teams (+ 3%, P < .042, ηp2 = .087) and mean weekly physical activity duration (+ 154.74′, P < .002, ηp2 = .071) in the intervention group. A significant (P < .012, ηp2 = .130) effect on body composition was observed in the intervention group. Conclusions: Participation in team sport may be an effective method to improve the aerobic fitness and physical activity behaviour of employees, and promote interpersonal communication between colleagues. Individual health outcomes and social interactions have the capacity to influence the health of the organisation. The extent of which these findings are replicable across a scope of organisations should be examined objectively over the long term.","2017-12","2020-02-29 09:49:45","2020-03-01 08:04:34","2020-02-29 09:49:45","30","","1","3","","Sports Med - Open","It's Time to Start Changing the Game","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\XHYRG7FK\Brinkley et al. - 2017 - It's Time to Start Changing the Game A 12-Week Wo.pdf","","well-being; quasi-experimental; RCT; included; team sport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The global burden of burnout cost is in excess of $300 billion annually. Locally, just under half of working Australians experience high levels of occupational burnout. Consequently, burnout interventions are paramount to organisational productivity. Exercise has the potential to provide a multilevel and cost effective burnout intervention. The current study aims to extend the literature by comparing cardiovascular with resistance exercise to assess their relative effectiveness against well-being, perceived stress, and burnout. Design. Participants were 49 (36 females and 13 males) previously inactive volunteers ranging in age from 19 to 68 that completed a four week exercise program of either cardiovascular, resistance, or no exercise (control). Randomised control trial design was employed. Method. Participants were measured against the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results. After four weeks of exercise participants had greater positive well-being and personal accomplishment, and concomitantly less psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Cardiovascular exercise was found to increase well-being and decrease psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Resistance training was noticeably effective in increasing well-being and personal accomplishment and to reduce perceived stress. The present findings revealed large effect sizes suggesting that exercise may be an effective treatment for burnout. However, given a small sample size further research needs to be conducted. Conclusion. Exercise has potential to be an effective burnout intervention. Different types of exercise may assist employees in different ways. Organisations wishing to proactively reduce burnout can do so by encouraging their employees to access regular exercise programs.","2015-04-09","2020-02-29 09:47:57","2020-03-01 08:02:41","2020-02-29 09:47:57","e891","","","3","","","Reducing workplace burnout","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3GAZHEV7\Bretland and Thorsteinsson - 2015 - Reducing workplace burnout the relative benefits .pdf","","physical activity; RCT; included; stress; burnout; resistance exercise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Baseline and follow-up data on sickness-absence rates and programme costs were collected retrospectively via a web survey of all participating organizations. Changes over time were calculated using 95% conﬁdence intervals of the mean, supplemented by hypothesis testing using a t-test. The indicative cost–beneﬁts of the intervention were also calculated. Results Participation was associated with a mean reduction in sickness absence of 0.26–1.6 days per employee per year depending on the length and level of participation in the programme. The estimated cost for the programme was £3 per sickness-absence day saved. Conclusions These results suggest that the Better Health at Work Award could be a cost-effective way of improving health and reducing sickness absence particularly in the public sector.

Research targeting specific lifestyle behaviors has shown that interventions using smartphones can be effective. However, few studies have evaluated solutions with multicomponent interventions, tailoring the intervention to the specific needs of the participant using a combination of mHealth and conventional treatment. To accomplish this, we developed Health Integrator, an mHealth platform with services and offers in the areas of diet, physical activity, sleeping habits, stress, alcohol and tobacco use. In the system, the user selects an area of intervention together with a health coach and set weekly goals. This study protocol presents the design and methodology of the Health Integrator Study, a randomized controlled trial to promote improved lifestyle behaviors. Methods: A three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (1:1:1) is conducted in the Stockholm County, Sweden. In total, 209 employees at a four different companies representing both white and blue collar workers, have been recruited. Participants are randomized to either a control group or to one of two intervention groups receiving a 3month lifestyle behavior change program including either 1) use of Health Integrator and monthly health coaching sessions or 2) only Health Integrator. At baseline and follow-up after 3- and 6-months, all participants answer questionnaires assessing lifestyle behaviors and quality of life. At baseline and the 3-month follow-up (end of intervention period), weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure are measured, and all participants wear an Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days to assess physical activity. Blood lipid profile and HbA1c are measured among all participants at baseline. If baseline measures fall outside the normal range, a second measurement is done after 3 months. Discussion: The Health Integrator Intervention Study will evaluate if a personalized intervention combining mHealth and conventional programs for lifestyle change, with or without additional health coach sessions, can improve lifestyle behaviors and quality of life. Based on the results from this trial, Health Integrator can easily be implemented within a broad public. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03579342.

As part of a nonrandomized pre–post intervention study, 36 nurses completed measures of health, stress, burnout, self-compassion, serenity, and empathy at three points in time. Between baseline (Time 1) and the end of the 8-week tMBSR intervention (Time 2), participants showed improvement in general health, t(37) = 2.8, p < .01, decreased stress, t(37) = 6.8, p < .001, decreased work burnout, t(37) = 4.0, p < .001, and improvement in several other areas. Improvements were sustained 4 months later (Time 3), and individuals who continued their MBSR practice after the program demonstrated better outcomes than those that did not. Findings suggest that the tMBSR program can be a low cost, feasible, and scalable intervention that shows positive impact on health and well-being, and could allow MBSR to be delivered to employees who are otherwise unable to access traditional, on-site programs.","2013-04-01","2020-02-29 02:54:36","2020-03-01 05:54:26","2020-02-29 02:54:36","107-133","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","PMID: 23667348","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\V8B34BZ3\bazarko_et_al_2013_the_impact_of_an_innovative_mindfulness-based_stress_reduction_program_on_the.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\7TTPMMSZ\15555240.2013.html","","well-being; excluded; pre-post intervention study; non-randomised; nurses; no valid comparison group; nur","nursing; stress; burnout; meditation; healthcare; Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We emphasize the necessity of longitudinal designs for understanding development and aging and discuss methodological issues that should be considered for achieving reproducible research on within-person processes.

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.","2018-03-13","2020-03-06 02:57:27","2020-04-18 08:15:20","2020-03-06 02:57:22","2600-2606","","11","115","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","tex.ids: nosek_preregistration_2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising--on campus as well as nationally. How did this happen? First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker; Always trust your feelings; and Life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths contradict basic psychological principles about well-being and ancient wisdom from many cultures. Embracing these untruths -- and the resulting culture of safetyism -- interferes with young people's social, emotional, and intellectual development. It makes it harder for them to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life. Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths. They explore changes in childhood such as the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised, child-directed play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. They examine changes on campus, including the corporatization of universities and the emergence of new ideas about identity and justice.""--Jacket.","2018","2020-03-08 04:32:44","2020-03-08 04:32:44","","","","","","","","The coddling of the American mind","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 1007552624","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying effective workplace strategies to help improve the resilience of nurses is therefore a high priority. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of a mindfulness-based intervention aimed at reducing compassion fatigue and improving emotional well-being in nurses. A total of 21 nurses recruited from a large teaching hospital in Western Australia, participated in a mindful self-care and resiliency (MSCR) intervention. The intervention consisted of a 1-day compassion fatigue prevention educational workshop, followed by a series of weekly mindfulness training seminars conducted over 4 weeks (12 h total intervention time). Participants completed a number of standardized measures at pre, post, and 1-month follow-up. Significant improvements were observed following the intervention for compassion satisfaction, burnout, trait-negative affect, obsessive passion, and stress scores. At pre-intervention, 45 % of the sample had high burnout scores, but this reduced to just 15 % by post-intervention. No significant changes were observed for general resilience, anxiety, or secondary traumatic stress post-intervention or at follow-up. The results of this preliminary study indicate that MSCR may represent a feasible approach to improving resilience and well-being among nurses. Further research utilizing a control group is required to strengthen conclusions.","2016-06-01","2020-03-11 00:07:15","2020-03-11 01:07:33","2020-03-11 00:07:15","764-774","","3","7","","Mindfulness","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\73P5F2NZ\Craigie et al. - 2016 - A Pilot Evaluation of a Mindful Self-care and Resi.pdf","","excluded; pilot; Nurses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For data collection, questionnaires were used to characterize the workers, as well as the Workplace Stress Scale and the Corlett Diagram. The research took place in three stages: first: pre-test with the application of the questionnaires to the subjects; second: Workplace Exercise taking place twice a week, for 15 minutes, during a period of 10 weeks; third: post-test in which the subjects answered the questionnaires again. For data analysis, the descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistics were used through the Wilcoxon Test.RESULTS: work-related stress was present in the assessed workers, but there was no statistically significant reduction in the scores after undergoing Workplace Exercise. However, there was a statistically significant pain reduction in the neck, cervical, upper, middle and lower back, right thigh, left leg, right ankle and feet.CONCLUSION: the Workplace Exercise promoted a significant pain reduction in the spine, but did not result in a significant reduction in the levels of work-related stress.           ,              OBJETIVOS: evaluar el efecto de un programa de Gimnástica Laboral compensatoria en trabajadores, visando a reducir el estrés ocupacional y dolor osteomuscular.MÉTODO: investigación de diseño casi-experimental con análisis cuantitativo de los dados, desarrollado con 30 trabajadores administrativos de una Institución pública de Educación Superior. Para recolectar los datos fueron adoptados cuestionarios de caracterización de los trabajadores, Escala de Estrés en el Trabajo y Diagrama de Corlett. La investigación fue desarrollada en tres etapas: primera: pre-prueba con la aplicación de los cuestionarios a los sujetos; segunda: Gimnástica Laboral con frecuencia de dos veces semanales, duración de 15 minutos cada, durante 10 semanas; tercera: post-prueba en que los sujetos respondieron otra vez los cuestionarios. Para analizar los datos fueron utilizadas estadística descriptiva y estadística no paramétrica mediante la Prueba de Wilcoxon.RESULTADOS: se constató presencia de estrés ocupacional en los trabajadores evaluados, pero sin reducción estadísticamente significativa de los scores después de la Gimnástica Laboral. Sin embargo, se encontró reducción del dolor estadísticamente significativa en el cuello, cervical, espalda superior, medio e inferior, muslo derecho, pierna izquierda, tobillo derecho y pies.CONCLUSIÓN: la Gimnástica laboral promovió reducción significativa de dolores en la columna vertebral, pero no llevó a una reducción significativa de los niveles de estrés ocupacional.           ,              OBJETIVO: avaliar o efeito de um programa de Ginástica Laboral compensatória em trabalhadores, visando a redução do estresse ocupacional e da dor osteomuscular.MÉTODO: pesquisa de delineamento quase-experimental, com análise quantitativa dos dados, realizada com 30 trabalhadores administrativos de uma instituição pública de ensino superior. Para a coleta dos dados foram adotados questionários de caracterização dos trabalhadores, Escala de Estresse no Trabalho e Diagrama de Corlett. A pesquisa ocorreu em três etapas - primeira: pré-teste que constou da aplicação dos questionários aos sujeitos, segunda: ginástica laboral com frequência de duas vezes semanais, duração de 15 minutos cada, no período de 10 semanas, terceira: pós-teste em que os sujeitos responderam novamente aos questionários. Para análise dos dados utilizaram-se estatística descritiva e estatística não paramétrica por meio do teste de Wilcoxon.RESULTADOS: constatou-se presença de estresse ocupacional nos trabalhadores avaliados, entretanto, sem redução estatisticamente significativa dos escores após a ginástica laboral. Contudo, houve redução álgica estatisticamente significativa em pescoço, cervical, costas superiores, médias e inferiores, coxa direita, perna esquerda, tornozelo direito e pés.CONCLUSÃO: a ginástica laboral promoveu redução significativa de algias na coluna vertebral; todavia, não promoveu redução significativa dos níveis de estresse ocupacional.","2014-08","2020-03-11 01:38:15","2020-03-11 05:02:49","2020-03-11 01:38:15","629-636","","4","22","","Rev.

In this quasi-experimental cohort study, intervention workgroups attended capacity-building workshops and developed and implemented action plans to reduce work and organizational stress risk factors (e.g., job design, performance management, work quality, and organizational change) and stress outcomes (e.g., work stress, morale, and sickness absence duration). There were 5 intervention and 17 control workgroups. An existing organizational development survey of work conditions and well-being was administered as a risk assessment and evaluation tool. Data were collected before the intervention (Time 1 [T1], Intervention n = 94, Control n = 511) and 12 months after (Time 2 [T2], Intervention, n = 123, Control n = 556). Multivariate analysis of variance showed a Group (Intervention vs. Control) × Time (T1 vs. T2) interaction effect with significant improvements for job design, training and development, and morale; and marginal effects for quality and positive performance management. Positive organizational change was not significant. Organizational sickness absence duration decreased, which is consistent with an intervention effect. Results were quite robust against competing explanations (i.e., changing cohorts), although regression to the mean could explain improvements in morale. Top management commitment and support, worker participation, and action plan implementation appeared important for positive change. We discuss the challenges associated with organizational stress interventions that for sustainability reasons try to capitalize on organizational processes.

Methods Personnel from a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) were randomized to a stress reduction intervention or a wait-list control group. The 8-week group mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) included mindfulness, gentle yoga and music. Psychological and biological markers of stress were measured one week before and one week after the intervention. Results Levels of salivary α-amylase, an index of sympathetic activation, were significantly decreased between the 1st and 2nd assessments in the intervention group with no changes in the control group. There was a positive correlation between salivary α-amylase levels and burnout scores. Conclusions These data suggest that this type of intervention could not only decrease reactivity to stress, but also decrease the risk of burnout.","2015-04","2020-03-11 01:50:52","2020-03-11 02:20:16","2020-03-11 01:50:52","393-399","","4","57","","J Occup Environ Med","A Small Randomized Pilot Study of a Workplace Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Surgical Intensive Care Unit Personnel","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25629803 PMCID: PMC4624325","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\FBTJKW46\Duchemin et al. - 2015 - A Small Randomized Pilot Study of a Workplace Mind.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624325/","hospital setting; RCT; included; MBSR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interventions               The intervention group received a height adjustable workstation, a brief seminar with supporting leaflet, workstation instructions with sitting and standing targets, feedback on sitting and physical activity at three time points, posters, action planning and goal setting booklet, self monitoring and prompt tool, and coaching sessions (month 1 and every three months thereafter).

Differences between groups (in favour of the intervention group compared with control) were observed for occupational sitting time at three months (−50.62 min/workday, −78.71 to −22.54, P<0.001) and six months (−64.40 min/workday, −97.31 to −31.50, P<0.001) and daily sitting time at six months (−59.32 min/day, −88.40 to −30.25, P<0.001) and 12 months (−82.39 min/day, −114.54 to −50.26, P=0.001). Group differences (in favour of the intervention group compared with control) were found for prolonged sitting time, standing time, job performance, work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness presenteeism, daily anxiety, and quality of life. No differences were seen for sickness absenteeism.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of a 7.5-day personal growth-orientated leadership intervention among line supervisors on subordinate well-being at work in a public sector construction organization. Design/methodology/approach A quasi-experimental design was applied to investigate the effects on the subordinates’ perceptions of the psychosocial work environment, leadership, and well-being. The intervention group comprised the subordinates (n=49) of the leadership intervention units and the control group comprised the subordinates (n=96) of the non-participating units. Data were collected with pre- and post-measurement surveys and analysed with repeated measures ANCOVA. Findings The intervention improved the flow of information after adjusting for the subordinates’ level of participation in the organizational stress management programme and background variables. The subordinates’ perception of leadership or of their own well-being did not improve compared to the control group. Research limitations/implications More detailed and proximal outcome indicators are needed. Several measurements and a process evaluation of the implementation are recommended. Practical implications Line supervisors need to be informed about the goals and methods of a personal growth intervention in order to encourage them to meet their strengths and limitations. The improvement of blue-collar subordinate well-being through leadership development might benefit from more practical training approaches. Originality/value The personal growth approach to line supervisors’ development is rare.

We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT). Methods We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study. Results The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05). However, there was no statistically significant decrease in absolute and relative presenteeism (p = 0.44, ES = 0.15, −0.21 to 0.52, and p = 0.50, ES = 0.02, −0.34 to 0.39, respectively). Conclusion Remote CBT, including tCBT, may provide easy access to quality-assured effective psychotherapy for people in the work force who present with subthreshold depression.

Methods We performed within-trial cost-efficacy analysis and long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and recruited 231 desk-based workers, aged 24–65 years, across 14 worksites of one organization. Multicomponent workplace-delivered intervention was compared to usual practice. Main outcome measures including total device-measured workplace sitting time, body mass index (BMI), self-reported health-related quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life-8D, AQoL-8D), and absenteeism measured at 12 months. Results Compared to usual practice, the intervention was associated with greater cost (AU$431/person), benefits in terms of reduced workplace sitting time [-46.8 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% confidence interval (CI): -69.9– -23.7] and increased workplace standing time (42.2 minutes/8-hour workday, 95% CI 23.8–60.6). However, there were no significant benefits for BMI [0.148 kg/m2 (95% CI-1.407–1.703)], QoL-8D [-0.006 (95% CI -0.074–0.063)] and absenteeism [2.12 days (95% CI -2.01–6.26)]. The incremental cost-efficacy ratios (ICER) ranged from AU$9.94 cost/minute reduction in workplace sitting time to AU$13.37/minute reduction in overall sitting time. CEA showed the intervention contributed to higher life year (LY) gains [0.01 (95% CI 0.009–0.011)], higher health-adjusted life year (HALY) gains [0.012 (95% CI 0.0105 – 0.0135)], and higher net costs [AU$344 (95% CI $331–358)], with corresponding ICER of AU$34 443/LY and AU$28 703/HALY if the intervention effects were to be sustained for five-years. CEA results were sensitive to assumptions surrounding intervention-effect decay rate and discount rate. Conclusions The intervention was cost-effective over the lifetime of the cohort when scaled up to the national workforce and provides important evidence for policy-makers and workplaces regarding allocation of resources to reduce workplace sitting.","2018-09","2020-03-11 05:09:10","2020-03-11 05:09:33","2020-03-11 05:09:10","503-511","","5","44","","Scand J Work Environ Health","Economic evaluation of a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce office workers’ sitting time","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VYL7ZM2L\Gao et al. - 2018 - Economic evaluation of a randomized controlled tri.pdf","","excluded; wrong study design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background Absenteeism is a significant issue in health care and there is a need to avoid interventions that are seen to be negative, punitive or lead to sick nurses coming to work. Method Sixty-nine nurses working in a hospital in Eastern Canada received either: (1) absenteeism feedback with individual goal-setting, (2) absenteeism feedback with group goal-setting, or (3) no intervention, and were asked questions about how they could reduce their absenteeism. Results There was a significant decrease in the total number of days absent but no decrease in absent episodes, and a significant effect on fairness perceptions and discomfort feelings for the nurses in the absenteeism feedback conditions. Six categories of obstacles to reducing absenteeism were identified. Conclusions The interventions made nurses feel their absence rate was less fair and to experience greater feelings of discomfort.

The evidence for effective worker-directed interventions for employees with depressive symptoms is limited. Treating employees with depressive symptoms via the Internet before they report sick from work could be beneficial and cost saving. Objective: In this study, we tested the effectiveness over the period of 1 year of a Web-based guided self-help intervention, called Happy@Work, for employees with depressive symptoms who were not on sick leave. Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a worker-directed, Web-based, guided self-help intervention to care as usual (CAU) was carried out. We recruited employees from 6 companies via the company&#8217;s Intranet and by putting up posters. The inclusion criteria were elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score &#8805;16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and not being on sick leave. The intervention contained 6 lessons and consisted of problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy. Participants were asked to submit weekly assignments via the website after completion of a lesson and they received feedback from a coach via the website. Self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms (CES-D; primary outcome), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), work performance (Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, HPQ), duration of absenteeism, and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS; secondary outcomes), were completed at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Several subgroup and per-protocol analyses were performed. Results: A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group (n=116) or to CAU (n=115). Completion of assessments varied between 54%-74%. Improvement in depressive symptoms between baseline and posttreatment was shown in all participants and these effects sustained over time. However, there were no differences between the 2 groups (adjusted regression coefficient=0.46, 95% CI &#8211;2.11 to 3.03,  P =.72; Cohen&#8217;s  d =0.05). Differences between groups were also not significant for the secondary outcomes. No subgroups were identified to show differences between the groups, nor did we find a between-group effect in the per-protocol analyses. Conclusions: This study showed that a worker-directed, Web-based, guided self-help intervention was not more effective than CAU in reducing depressive symptoms among employees with depressive symptoms who were not on sick leave over the period of 1 year. An intervention for this specific target group might not be necessary because the recovery in the CAU group was comparable to the intervention group and sustained over a 12-month period.

A growing trend in corporate wellness programs is to offer wearable fitness trackers to employees to help them monitor their activity so that they can make better choices about their health. It is estimated that more than 13 million wearable fitness devices will be used in corporate wellness programs by 2018. Our research will explore this phenomena by investigating the effect of wearable fitness devices on employee identity and well-being. We will use a case study about a financial institution that has recently implemented the use of Fitbits as part of its corporate wellness program.

We hypothesise that mentoring programmes can have a positive impact on both mentees' and mentors' mental health. In a multi-method longitudinal study, we explore empirically the effect of a formal mentoring programme in the English police force on senior police officers' levels of anxiety. In the first step of our study, we conducted a field experiment. This experiment yielded preliminary results that suggest mentors may experience marginally lower levels of anxiety and feel as if their job is more meaningful when they participate in the mentoring programme. As a second step, we qualitatively investigated the subjective experience of the participants to explain and substantiate our findings. We found that mentoring relationships provide a unique context for mentors to discuss and normalise their concerns, to share ideas for managing anxieties, and to find more meaning in their work. We discuss our findings in terms of mentoring theory and consider their practical implications for improving mental health in the workplace.","2018-10-01","2020-03-11 05:30:01","2020-03-11 05:30:39","2020-03-11 05:30:01","201-213","","","108","","Journal of Vocational Behavior","Mentoring for mental health","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6EAG2DSM\S0001879118300897.html","","excluded; mixed methods; wrong study design","Mental health; Mentoring; Phenomenology; Police","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What is still not certain are the short, and long-term, health benefits arising from these workplace activity challenges. Research into workplace activity challenges is beset with a number of methodological obstacles that may, in part, explain why consistent outcomes have not been found from studies of this type. The aim of this study was to assess whether participation in a 16-week activity challenge would result in measurable changes in lipid profile, blood glucose, renal function, blood pressure, weight and health and well being as measured using a health and wellbeing assessment. The study demonstrated that participants could increase their levels of activity and maintain at least 10,000 steps a day for a period of 16 weeks. The study also identified that participants in teams were significantly more active than those participating as individuals. Furthermore, attrition from the activity challenge was greater amongst participants not in a team. This demonstrated the importance of social interactions, support and possibly other factors that being part of a group brought to the experience of participating in the activity challenge.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the change in health behavior following a three-month exercise program based in the workplace. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study design was used in which 165 employees participated in the study. An intervention program of workplace exercise was applied for three months. Participants were assessed through the transtheoretical model and stages of change questionnaire before and after intervention to understand changes in their position on the behavioral change continuum. RESULTS: The number of employees who were physically active increased after the workplace exercise intervention (13.9%, 95% CI 9.5 to 20.1; P = 0.009).

During the first portion of the study, group 1 (n = 18) acted as the intervention group while group 2 (n = 25) acted as the control group. During the second portion, the intervention was replicated, and the roles of the two groups were switched. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires at baseline (t1), week 6 (t2), and week 11 (t3) and examined using both analysis of variance and prediction analysis. The results showed that mindfulness increased while psychological distress (stress, anxiety/depression, fatigue, and negative affect) decreased for all employees throughout the intervention, especially among those with low mindfulness scores at baseline. The satisfaction level of the employees’ internal clients significantly increased over time, although the effect size was small. This article contributes to the field of mindfulness at work by (1) introducing a novel MBI specifically designed for call centers, (2) assessing the impact of the intervention on client satisfaction, and (3) doing so using a research design and a statistical technique which have never been used in mindfulness studies.","2015-08-01","2020-03-11 05:50:57","2020-03-11 05:51:54","2020-03-11 05:50:57","836-847","","4","6","","Mindfulness","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ZXI68J6I\Grégoire and Lachance - 2015 - Evaluation of a Brief Mindfulness-Based Interventi.pdf","","mindfulness; quasi-experimental; included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The study design was quasi-experimental. All participants received a standard individual treatment for stress at a company healthcare unit. Half of the sample was also enrolled in a group intervention aimed at coping with psychological/somatic symptoms of stress. Data were collected before and after treatment and at 6- and 12-month followups, through questionnaires and blood sampling. Rates of return to work were assessed for up to 5 years. Results: Levels of depression decreased in both conditions and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. The experimental condition was superior in alleviating burnout, as measured with the Karolinska Exhaustion Scale. Paradoxically, these improvements were accompanied by significant increases in levels of glycated haemoglobin in both groups. At 5-year follow-up 40% of participants in both conditions had returned to work. Conclusion: The stress management intervention seems to have beneficial effects on self-rated symptoms, but is comparable to treatment as usual with respect to rates of return to work.

Sick and healthy individuals who improved their health increased productivity by about 10%, with surveys indicating sources in improved diet and exercise. Although the small worker sample limits both estimate precision and our ability to isolate mechanisms behind this increase, we argue that our results are consistent with improved worker motivation and capability.

Methods Eligible workers were cluster-randomized into intervention (N=193) and control (N=222) groups. Intervention group members participated in three workshops where they mapped positive and negative aspects of their physical and psychosocial work environment and developed action plans addressing the highlighted issues, which were subsequently implemented by the participants. Questionnaire-based data on work ability and recovery were collected at baseline and 8-, 10- and 12-month follow-up. Data on productivity, well-being, mental health, and physical demands and resources were collected at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Results The intervention was delivered and received as planned (100% planned workshops conducted, 69% [standard deviation (SD) 7%] participation in workshops) and with a response rate of 76% (SD 8%) to the questionnaires. No significant between-group improvements for any of the outcomes were found in intention-to-treat multi-level mixed models. On the contrary, tendencies were observed for poorer recovery and reduced work ability in the intervention compared to control group. Conclusion The intervention did not improve the outcomes. This result can have several explanations, such as a regression-toward-the-mean effect or that the intervention might have put an additional burden on the workers already facing high work demands. In addition, there may have been an insufficient match between the intervention components implemented and the predetermined outcomes, and implementation may have been unsuccessful. These potential explanations need to be investigated using process evaluation data.","2018-01","2020-03-11 05:57:58","2020-03-11 05:58:36","2020-03-11 05:57:58","58-68","","1","44","","Scand J Work Environ Health","Effectiveness of a participatory physical and psychosocial intervention to balance the demands and resources of industrial workers","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\SVBJMFBF\Gupta et al. - 2018 - Effectiveness of a participatory physical and psyc.pdf","","RCT; included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efforts to increase PA have included workplace health promotion. Currently, little is known about the effect of these programs on overall HRQoL. Aim: To evaluate whether participation in a pedometer-based PA program in the workplace was associated with changes in HRQoL. Methods: 487 voluntary employees enrolled in a health program completed the SF-12 Health Survey at baseline and 4 months. Change in Physical and Mental component summary scores (PCS; MCS) was assessed with multivariable regression analysis, adjusting for covariates. Results: Participation in the program was associated with an increase of 1.5 MCS units (95% CI: 0.76, –2.09). Greater improvements in MCS were observed in those reporting an increased level of PA during the program [1.9 (CI: 0.78, 2.92) versus 0.9 (CI: –0.12, 2.03)] and a lower baseline MCS score [6.3 (CI: 4.80, 7.62) versus –1.5 (CI: –2.21, –0.80)].

The program aims to reduce stress at the work–parenting interface by targeting family risk and protective factors and assisting parents to manage competing work and family demands. Ninety-seven part- and full-time working parents (74 mothers and 23 fathers; intervention group: n = 42 parents; waitlist-control group n = 55 parents) from multiple organizations and multiple occupations with children between 2 and 10 years were randomly assigned to an intervention and a waitlist-control condition. After the training, parents from the intervention condition, compared to those from the waitlist-control condition, reported a significant reduction in individual and work-related stress. Additionally, they reported a significant reduction in dysfunctional parenting and significant higher levels of parental and occupational self-efficacy. Within the intervention condition all effects were maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up examinations. The findings support the notion that WPTP promotes parental well-being and reduces stress at the work–parenting interface. Given that strengthening parenting skills has the potential to strengthen work, strategies to implement WPTP in organizational resources and community-based services are discussed.

Departmental managers were responsible for implementing changes to reduce exposure to these factors. Employees' perceptions of exposure to the intervention and its impact on their work were measured in 2007 through questionnaires. Psychological demands, decision latitude, social support and rewards measured in 2005 and 2007 were used to assess outcomes. Employees who perceived that they had been exposed to the intervention changes showed more improvement in outcomes than those who did not perceive changes. The greatest differences in outcomes were found in those participants who perceived that workplace changes had improved their work situation as compared to those who perceived the changes as neutral or negative.

Design A cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting Four cities in Finland, 2002–2005. Participants 504 workers in 119 municipal kitchens. Intervention Kitchens were randomised to intervention (n=59) and control (n=60) groups. The intervention lasted 11–14 months and was based on the workers' active participation in work analysis, planning and implementing the ergonomic changes aimed at decreasing the physical and mental workload. Main outcome measures Mental stress, mental strenuousness of work, hurry, job satisfaction, job control, skill discretion, co-worker relationships and supervisor support. Data were collected by questionnaire at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at a 12-month follow-up (PI 12 ). Results At the end of the intervention, the OR of job dissatisfaction for the intervention group as compared with the control group was 3.0 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.5), of mental stress 2.3 (1.2 to 4.7) and of poor co-worker relationships 2.3 (1.0 to 5.2). At the PI 12 , the OR of job dissatisfaction was 3.0 (1.2 to 7.8). Analysis of the independent and joint effects of the intervention and unconnected organisational reforms showed that adverse changes were accentuated among those with exposure to both. Conclusions No favourable effects on psychosocial factors at work were found. The adverse changes were due to a joint effect of the intervention and the unconnected organisational reforms.

Web-based interventions offer the opportunity to deliver effective solutions on a large scale; however, the evidence is limited and the results conflicting. Objective: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of guided Web- and mobile-based stress management training for employees. Methods: A total of 264 employees with elevated symptoms of stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10, PSS-10≥22) were recruited from the general working population and randomly assigned to an Internet-based stress management intervention (iSMI) or waitlist control group. The intervention (GET.ON Stress) was based on Lazarus’s transactional model of stress, consisted of seven sessions, and applied both well-established problem solving and more recently developed emotion regulation strategies. Participants also had the opportunity to request automatic text messages on their mobile phone along with the iSMI. Participants received written feedback on every completed session from an e-coach. The primary outcome was perceived stress (PSS-10). Web-based self-report assessments for both groups were scheduled at baseline, 7 weeks, and 6 months. At 12 months, an extended follow-up was carried out for the iSMI group only. Results: An intention-to-treat analysis of covariance revealed significantly large effect differences between iSMI and waitlist control groups for perceived stress at posttest (F1,261=58.08, P<.001; Cohen’s d=0.83) and at the 6-month follow-up (F1,261=80.17, P<.001; Cohen’s d=1.02). The effects in the iSMI group were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: This Web- and mobile-based intervention has proven effective in reducing stress in employees in the long term. Internet-based stress management interventions should be further pursued as a valuable alternative to face-to-face interventions.

Participants (N = 22) completed an 8-week online mindfulness-based program. Immediately before and after a mindfulness session, participants completed questionnaires to assess the short-term effects on mood and state anxiety and provided saliva samples to assess salivary alpha amylase (sAA) concentrations. Additionally, pre and post the 8-week intervention, participants completed questionnaires assessing workplace stress, over-commitment, work engagement, dispositional mindfulness and personal resources. Saliva samples were collected to measure the cortisol awakening response, sAA awakening response and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA).

The objective of this study was, therefore, to determine the effectiveness of a stress management intervention, designed to improve stress reactivity, for mental health and sleep problems seven years later, using longitudinal data from 101 male industrial workers. Linear regressions estimated the adjusted effects of the changes in stress reactivity in general as well as in its six subdimensions (work overload, social conflict, social stress, failure at work, and anticipatory and prolonged reactivity) on depression, anxiety, and sleep problems seven years later. The improvement of the prolonged reactivity had positive effects on depression, anxiety, and sleep problems (unstandardized regression coefficients [Bs] ≥ 0.35, all p-values ≤ 0.01). Depression and sleep problems were further improved by a reduction of the reactivity to social conflicts (Bs ≥ 0.29, p-values &lt; 0.05), and an improvement in the overall reactivity score positively influenced sleep problems (B = 0.07, p = 0.017). In conclusion, the improvement of stress reactivity resulting from a work stress intervention was effective and generally long-lasting in preventing mental health and sleep problems.

Employees (n = 39) in a Dutch police district received a 1-day training, after which they worked towards self-set crafting goals for a period of 4 weeks. The intervention concluded with a half-day reflection session in which learning points were consolidated. Participating in the intervention was expected to boost job resources such as opportunities for development and leader–member exchange (LMX), as well as enhance self-efficacy and positive affect and to reduce negative affect. Repeated measures ANOVAs did not yield significant results. However, pre–post comparison tests showed that the intervention group reported less negative affect as well as increased self-efficacy, developmental opportunities and LMX in the post-measure compared with the pre-measure. The control group (n = 47) showed no significant changes from pre- to post-measure. In addition, in weeks during which individuals sought more resources, they also reported more developmental opportunities, LMX, and positive affect. Although further research is needed, the job crafting intervention seems to have potential to enable employees to proactively build a motivating work environment and to improve their own well-being. Practitioner points Job crafting is proactive behaviour at work that allows employees to redesign their own jobs. In weeks when employees actively focus on building job resources, they also find more job resources and experience more positive affect. The job crafting intervention may help employees to build resources and affective well-being at work.","2015","2020-03-11 22:48:10","2020-03-11 22:49:03","2020-03-11 22:48:10","511-532","","3","88","","","The job crafting intervention","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joop.12128","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6V3HVD9G\Heuvel et al. - 2015 - The job crafting intervention Effects on job reso.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\IMCN8UE3\joop.html","","quasi-experimental; included","job crafting; intervention; affective well-being; job resources; self-efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 5 Steps to Safer Surgery (5SSS) incorporates pre-list briefings, the three steps of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) and post-list debriefings in one framework. We aimed to identify any changes in safety culture associated with the introduction of the 5SSS in orthopaedic operating theatres. Methods We assessed the safety culture in the elective orthopaedic theatres of a large UK teaching hospital before and after introduction of the 5SSS using a modified version of the Safety Attitude Questionnaire - Operating Room (SAQ-OR). Primary outcome measures were pre-post intervention changes in the six safety culture domains of the SAQ-OR. We also analysed changes in responses to two items regarding perioperative briefings. Results The SAQ-OR survey response rate was 80% (60/75) at baseline and 74% (53/72) one yr later.

Methods A longitudinal research design was adopted. In total, 144 participants were randomized to the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group participated in MBI for eight weeks. Measurements were collected for both groups at five time points: at pre-intervention (T1), at mid-intervention (T2), at the completion of intervention (T3), four weeks after intervention (T4), and eight weeks after intervention (T5). Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. A linear mixed model with two levels was employed to analyze the repeated measurement data. Results Compared with the control group, the intercepts (means at T3) for the intervention group were significantly lower on psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress when MBI was completed. Even with the demographic variables controlled, the positive effects remained. For growth rates of prolonged fatigue and perceived stress, participants in the intervention group showed a steeper decrease than did the participants in the control group. Regarding job strain, although the intercept (mean at T3) of job demands showed a significant decline when BMI was completed, the significance disappeared when the demographic variables were controlled. Moreover, the other results for job control and job demands did not show promising findings. Conclusion As a workplace health promotion program, the MBI seems to have potential in improving mental illness risks for employees with poor mental health. However, there was insufficient evidence to support its effect on mitigating job strain. Further research on maintaining the positive effects on mental health for the long term and on developing innovative MBI to suit job strain are recommended.

Study 1 was a 5-day diary study with 219 employees and revealed that mindfulness negatively related to emotional exhaustion and positively related to job satisfaction at both the within- and the between-person levels. Both relationships were mediated by surface acting at both levels of analysis.

In this study, we therefore investigated the effectiveness of a low-dose mindfulness intervention for recovery from work. In addition, differential responding to the treatment in terms of treatment-by-baseline interactions was studied. A sample of 140 employees participated in a randomized field experiment with a self-training and a wait-list control group. Three central recovery processes (psychological detachment, sleep quality, and sleep duration) were assessed with event-sampling methodology involving daily measurements over 10 workdays. Growth curve analyses revealed intervention effects on sleep quality and sleep duration. No effects were found for psychological detachment after work and for the proposed treatment-by-baseline interactions. Our findings are discussed in the context of occupational health promotion in general and mindfulness-based interventions in specific. Practitioner points Although daily recovery from the demands of work has been shown to be vital for employee well-being and performance, research on how workplace interventions can help improve recovery is still scarce.

Repeated cross-sectional surveys compared self-reported psychological distress (Kessler-10; K10) at commencement (N = 3406) and after 3 years (N = 3228). WHP availability and participation over time was assessed, and associations between the K10 and exposure to programs estimated. Analyses were repeated for a cohort subgroup (N = 580).

Both male and female employees with poorer mental health participated more often over time. Women’s psychological distress decreased over time but this change was only partially attributable to participation in WHP, and only to lifestyle interventions. Average psychological distress did not change over time for men. Unexpectedly, program components directly targeting mental health were not associated with distress for either men or women. Cohort results corroborated findings. Healthy@Work was successful in increasing participation across a range of program types, including for men and women with poorer mental health.

By developing evidence-based solutions that are practical, affordable, and accessible, there is potential to deliver substantial economic benefits while improving the lives of individual workers. Academic and industry groups are now responding to this public health issue. A key focus is on developing practical solutions that enhance the mental health and psychological resilience of workers. A growing body of research suggests resilience training may play a pivotal role in the realm of public health and prevention, particularly with regards to protecting the long-term well-being of workers. Objective: Our aim is to examine whether a mindfulness-based resilience-training program delivered via the internet is feasible and engaging to a group of high-risk workers. Additionally, we aim to measure the effect of the Resilience@Work Resilience@Work Mindfulness program on measures of resilience and related skills. Methods: The current pilot study recruited 29 full-time firefighters. Participants were enrolled in the 6-session internet-based resilience-training program and were administered questionnaires prior to training and directly after the program ended. Measurements examined program feasibility, psychological resilience, experiential avoidance, and thought entanglement. Results: Participants reported greater levels of resilience after Resilience@Work training compared to baseline, with a mean increase in their overall resilience score of 1.5 (95% CI -0.25 to 3.18, t14=1.84, P=.09). Compared to baseline, participants also reported lower levels of psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance following training, with a mean decrease of -1.8 (95% CI -3.78 to 0.20, t13=-1.94, P=.07). With regards to cognitive fusion (thought entanglement), paired-samples t tests revealed a trend towards reduction in mean scores post training (P=.12). Conclusions: This pilot study of the Resilience@Work program suggests that a mindfulness-based resilience program delivered via the Internet is feasible in a high-risk workplace setting. In addition, the firefighters using the program showed a trend toward increased resilience and psychological flexibility. Despite a number of limitations, the results of this pilot study provide some valuable insights into what form of resilience training may be viable in occupational settings particularly among those considered high risk, such as emergency workers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a mindfulness-based resilience-training program delivered wholly via the internet has been tested in the workplace.","2018-09-11","2020-03-11 23:29:10","2020-03-11 23:30:03","2020-03-11 23:29:10","e10326","","9","20","","J Med Internet Res","Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training in the Workplace","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PBJW2S59\Joyce et al. - 2018 - Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training in the Workp.pdf","","quasi-experimental; included; pilot; pilot study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emerging research describes positive outcomes from various types of resilience training programs (RTPs) among different occupational groups. One specific group of workers that may benefit from this form of proactive resilience training is first responders. Given the nature of their work, first responders are frequently exposed to stressful circumstances and potentially traumatic events, which may impact their overall resilience and well-being over time. Objective: This study aimed to examine whether a mindfulness-based RTP (the Resilience@Work [RAW] Mindfulness Program) delivered via the internet can effectively enhance resilience among a group of high-risk workers. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comprising 24 Primary Fire and Rescue and Hazmat stations within New South Wales. Overall, 12 stations were assigned to the 6-session RAW Mindfulness Program and 12 stations were assigned to the control condition. A total of 143 active full-time firefighters enrolled in the study. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, immediately post training, and at 6-month follow-up. Measurements examined change in both adaptive and bounce-back resilience as well as several secondary outcomes examining resilience resources and acceptance and mindfulness skills. Results: Mixed-model repeated measures analysis found that the overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P=.008), with the intervention group increasing in adaptive resilience over time. However, no significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control group in terms of change in bounce-back resilience (P=.09). At 6-month follow-up, the group receiving the RAW intervention had an average increase in their resilience score of 1.3, equating to a moderate-to-large effect size compared with the control group of 0.73 (95% CI 0.38-1.06). Per-protocol analysis found that compared with the control group, the greatest improvements in adaptive resilience were observed among those who completed most of the RAW program, that is, 5 to 6 sessions (P=.002). Conclusions: The results of this RCT suggest that mindfulness-based resilience training delivered in an internet format can create improvements in adaptive resilience and related resources among high-risk workers, such as first responders. Despite a number of limitations, the results of this study suggest that the RAW Mindfulness Program is an effective, scalable, and practical means of delivering online resilience training in high-risk workplace settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a mindfulness-based RTP delivered entirely via the internet has been tested in the workplace.","2019-02-19","2020-03-11 23:31:00","2020-03-11 23:31:56","2020-03-11 23:31:00","e12894","","2","21","","J Med Internet Res","Resilience@Work Mindfulness Program","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\YSQ58IRK\Joyce et al. - 2019 - Resilience@Work Mindfulness Program Results From .pdf","","RCT; included; first responders; has a pilot with same population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efﬁciently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62e71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05e0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no speciﬁc therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.","2020-03","2020-03-12 02:57:33","2020-03-12 02:58:53","2020-03-12 02:57:33","246-251","","3","104","","Journal of Hospital Infection","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\FRJVTUTZ\Kampf et al. - 2020 - Persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces.pdf","","epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beginning with a simple population model, the concept is developed for a threshold value of ℛ0 determining whether or not the disease dies out. The next generation matrix method of calculating ℛ0 in a compartmental model is described and illustrated. To address control strategies, type and target reproduction numbers are defined, as well as sensitivity and elasticity indices. These theoretical ideas are then applied to models that are formulated for West Nile virus in birds (a vector-borne disease), cholera in humans (a disease with two transmission pathways), anthrax in animals (a disease that can be spread by dead carcasses and spores), and Zika in humans (spread by mosquitoes and sexual contacts). Some parameter values from literature data are used to illustrate the results. Finally, references for other ways to calculate ℛ0 are given. These are useful for more complicated models that, for example, take account of variations in environmental fluctuation or stochasticity.","2017-08-01","2020-03-16 08:28:07","2020-03-16 08:28:07","2020-03-16 08:28:06","288-303","","3","2","","Infectious Disease Modelling","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\XW5B7BJB\van den Driessche - 2017 - Reproduction numbers of infectious disease models.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\9CRZ9XCP\S2468042717300209.html","","","Anthrax; Basic reproduction number; Cholera; Disease control; West Nile virus; Zika virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It depends on the duration of the infectious period, the probability of infecting a susceptible individual during one contact, and the number of new susceptible individuals contacted per unit of time. Therefore Ro may vary considerably for different infectious diseases but also for the same disease in different populations. The key threshold result of epidemic theory associates the outbreaks of epidemics and the persistence of endemic levels with basic reproduction numbers greater than one. Because the magnitude of R0 allows one to determine the amount of effort which is necessary either to prevent an epidemic or to eliminate an infection from a population, it is crucial to estimate Ro for a given disease in a particular population.

R0 specifies the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. R0 is used to assess the severity of the outbreak, as well as the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control. Conventionally, it is assumed that if R0>1 the outbreak generates an epidemic, and if R0<1 the outbreak becomes extinct. Here, we use computational and analytical methods to calculate the average number of secondary infections and to show that it does not necessarily represent an epidemic threshold parameter (as it has been generally assumed). Previously we have constructed a new type of individual-level model (ILM) and linked it with a population-level model. Our ILM generates the same temporal incidence and prevalence patterns as the population-level model; we use our ILM to directly calculate the average number of secondary infections (i.e., R0). Surprisingly, we find that this value of R0 calculated from the ILM is very different from the epidemic threshold calculated from the population-level model. This occurs because many different individual-level processes can generate the same incidence and prevalence patterns. We show that obtaining R0 from empirical contact tracing data collected by epidemiologists and using this R0 as a threshold parameter for a population-level model could produce extremely misleading estimates of the infectiousness of the pathogen, the severity of an outbreak, and the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control.","2007-03-14","2020-03-16 08:09:31","2020-04-17 10:01:22","2020-03-16 08:09:31","","","3","2","","PLoS One","Theory versus Data","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 17356693 PMCID: PMC1804098","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LNEK4EAQ\Breban et al. - 2007 - Theory versus Data How to Calculate R0.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\8WW6HH5N\Breban et al. - 2007 - Theory versus Data How to Calculate R0.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1804098/","how-to; epidemiological methods; individual compartmental model; R0; SIR model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18th January 2020, based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable – with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. In the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. Identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity –including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.","2020","2020-03-17 03:22:15","2020-03-17 03:22:15","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\AY7VPACV\Imai et al. - 2020 - Report 3 Transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity.   Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses.    Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak.     Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients.             Methods:             Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan.

Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed.

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making.   METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to relatively limited samples. CONCLUSIONS Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.","2020-03-16","2020-03-17 10:00:56","2020-03-17 10:01:27","2020-03-17 10:00:55","","","","","","","Clinical Characteristics of 34 Children with Coronavirus Disease-2019 in the West of China","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.12.20034686","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The clinical spectrum of COVID−19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID−19 severity.             Method             This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5             th             March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID−19 infection or ICU admission.             Results             Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID−19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 − 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 − 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 − 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 − 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 − 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 − 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity.             Conclusions             Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID−19.","2020-03-16","2020-03-17 10:00:56","2020-03-17 10:01:26","2020-03-17 10:00:55","","","","","","","","","","","","Public and Global Health","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Betacoronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are not thought to be seasonal. Methods: We examined climate data from cities with significant community spread of COVID-19 using ERA-5 reanalysis, and compared to areas that are either not affected, or do not have significant community spread.Findings: To date, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has established significant community spread in cities and regions along a narrow east west distribution roughly along the 30-50o N’ corridor at consistently similar weather patterns consisting of average temperatures of 5-11oC, combined with low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m3). There has been a lack of significant community establishment in expected locations that are based only on population proximity and extensive population interaction through travel. Interpretation:The distribution of significant community outbreaks along restricted latitude, temperature, and humidity are consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Additionally, we have proposed a simplified model that shows a zone at increased risk for COVID-19 spread. Using weather modeling, it may be possible to predict the regions most likely to be at higher risk of significant community spread of COVID-19 in the upcoming weeks, allowing for concentration of public health efforts on surveillance and containment.

Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures – so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) – aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology.

Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ≈8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.","2008-03-25","2020-03-20 00:03:24","2020-03-20 00:03:24","2020-03-20 00:03:24","4639-4644","","12","105","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 18332436 PMCID: PMC2290797","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GSLQX2DG\Halloran et al. - 2008 - Modeling targeted layered containment of an influe.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290797/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Molecular assays currently available for detection of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-Cov) have low sensitivity during the early stage of the illness. Objective: To develop and evaluate a sensitive diagnostic test for SARS by optimizing the viral RNA extraction methods and by applying real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology. Study design: 50 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples collected from days 1–3 of disease onset from SARS patients in whom SARS CoV infections was subsequently serologically confirmed and 30 negative control samples were studied. Samples were tested by: (1) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a routine RNA extraction method (Lancet 361 (2003) 1319), (2) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method, (3) a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method. Results: Of 50 NPA specimens collected during the first 3 days of illness, 11 (22%) were positive in our first generation RT-PCR assay. With a modification in the RNA extraction protocol, 22 (44%) samples were positive in the conventional RT-PCR assay. By combining the modified RNA extraction method and real-time quantitative PCR technology, 40 (80%) of these samples were positive in the real-time RT-PCR assay. No positive signal was observed in the negative controls. Conclusion: By optimizing RNA extraction methods and applying quantitative real time RT-PCR technologies, the sensitivity of tests for early diagnosis of SARS can be greatly enhanced.","2003-12-01","2020-03-20 01:02:20","2020-03-20 01:02:20","2020-03-20 01:02:20","233-238","","3","28","","Journal of Clinical Virology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\RAWP3SMY\Poon et al. - 2003 - Early diagnosis of SARS Coronavirus infection by r.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3QWYV93C\S1386653203002476.html","","","SARS Coronavirus; Early diagnosis; Real time RT-PCR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. Results We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46–0.51). Conclusions Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.","2020-01-10","2020-03-24 00:02:07","2020-03-24 00:02:07","2020-03-24 00:02:07","350-354","","2","38","","Vaccine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\E2FGKK2B\Wolff - 2020 - Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interf.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6S2HSRWH\S0264410X19313647.html","","","Department of Defense; Influenza vaccine; Respiratory illness; Virus interference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effects of new and emerging tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, on the immune status of the respiratory epithelium are largely unknown. We conducted a clinical study collecting superficial nasal scrape biopsies, nasal lavage, urine, and serum from nonsmokers, cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette users and assessed them for changes in immune gene expression profiles. Smoking status was determined based on a smoking history and a 3- to 4-wk smoking diary and confirmed using serum cotinine and urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) levels. Total RNA from nasal scrape biopsies was analyzed using the nCounter Human Immunology v2 Expression panel. Smoking cigarettes or vaping e-cigarettes resulted in decreased expression of immune-related genes. All genes with decreased expression in cigarette smokers (n = 53) were also decreased in e-cigarette smokers. Additionally, vaping e-cigarettes was associated with suppression of a large number of unique genes (n = 305). Furthermore, the e-cigarette users showed a greater suppression of genes common with those changed in cigarette smokers. This was particularly apparent for suppressed expression of transcription factors, such as EGR1, which was functionally associated with decreased expression of 5 target genes in cigarette smokers and 18 target genes in e-cigarette users. Taken together, these data indicate that vaping e-cigarettes is associated with decreased expression of a large number of immune-related genes, which are consistent with immune suppression at the level of the nasal mucosa.","2016-07-01","2020-03-24 22:11:54","2020-03-24 22:11:54","2020-03-24 22:11:54","L135-L144","","1","311","","Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27288488 PMCID: PMC4967187","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\2288KEL7\Martin et al. - 2016 - E-cigarette use results in suppression of immune a.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4967187/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2–14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3–4 days without truncation and at 5–9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.","2020-02-17","2020-03-30 22:09:16","2020-04-18 08:14:02","2020-03-30 22:09:16","538","","2","9","","JCM","Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Characteristics of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections with Right Truncation","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","tex.ids: linton_incubation_2020","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ICWX8U43\Linton et al. - 2020 - Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Charac.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\HIRKJ95X\Linton et al. - 2020 - Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Charac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV.

Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature. This tool should help epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.","2013-11-01","2020-04-04 15:50:24","2020-04-04 15:50:24","2020-04-04 15:50:24","1505-1512","","9","178","","Am J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24043437 PMCID: PMC3816335","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ZKTSQAKL\Cori et al. - 2013 - A New Framework and Software to Estimate Time-Vary.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816335/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.","2019-12-01","2020-04-05 08:34:07","2020-04-05 08:34:07","2020-04-05 08:34:07","100356","","","29","","Epidemics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\9I4XTYZG\Thompson et al. - 2019 - Improved inference of time-varying reproduction nu.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\JQPNYN88\S1755436519300350.html","","","Infectious disease epidemiology; Disease control; Mathematical modelling; Parameter inference; Reproduction number; Serial interval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.","2020-03-08","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\FT7ZI35H\Ganyani et al. - 2020 - Estimating the generation interval for COVID-19 ba.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation.  Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age.  Interpretation:  These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.","2020-03-13","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\FLH9RLQW\Verity et al. - 2020 - Estimates of the severity of COVID-19 disease.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age ≥ 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process. Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness. Patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 facilitated severe illness, and they should rapidly access to intensive care unit if necessary.","2020-02-12","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.02.10.20021584","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PFM2XV5A\Liu et al. - 2020 - Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts Severe Ill.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world's highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.","2020-03-06","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","","","","","","","Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the early stages of an epidemic","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.04.20031104","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\MQASSIZR\Hauser et al. - 2020 - Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the earl.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.","2020-03-08","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\38T5NQUF\Woelfel et al. - 2020 - Clinical presentation and virological assessment o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods:  We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin,  China,  reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring.  Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.","2020-03-06","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.03.20029983","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VNUG9BXS\Tindale et al. - 2020 - Transmission interval estimates suggest pre-sympto.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown.  Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190/μL) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 andlactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively. During disease course,T lymphocytes were generally lower,neutrophils higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocytes did not increase at the 20th days after illness onset. Conclusion: The epidemiological features areimportant for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactateare independent prognostic factors.

Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","2020-02-09","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","2020-04-06 02:38:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.02.06.20020941","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\HQ39WZYR\Zhao et al. - 2020 - Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years <i>vs</i> 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–7·6) in those aged 80 years or older.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>UK Medical Research Council.</p>","2020-03-30","2020-04-06 02:52:54","2020-04-18 07:27:26","2020-04-06 02:52:54","","","0","0","","The Lancet Infectious Diseases","Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","tex.ids: verity_estimates_2020 PMID: 32240634 Publisher: Elsevier","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\T32M9KDC\Verity et al. - 2020 - Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\5SLCZSQA\Verity et al. - 2020 - Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2.pdf; ; ; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\7EP69FNF\fulltext.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GNDUMKZY\fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240634; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240634","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.                                         Methods               The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.                                         Results               Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6–8. There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness. Active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract puts the prospects of COVID-19 containment in perspective.","2020-04-01","2020-04-07 23:39:20","2020-04-07 23:39:20","2020-04-07 23:39:20","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\QH54TEPV\s41586-020-2196-x.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We extended methods for prospective estimation of the effective reproduction number, (Rt), over time in an emerging epidemic to allow for reporting delays and repeated importations. We estimated Rt based on case notifications and hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infections in Hong Kong from June through October 2009 Results Rt declined from around 1.4–1.5 at the start of the local epidemic to around 1.1–1.2 later in the summer, suggesting changes in transmissibility perhaps related to school vacations or seasonality. Estimates of Rt based on hospitalizations of confirmed H1N1 cases closely matched estimates based on case notifications. Conclusion Real-time monitoring of the effective reproduction number is feasible and can provide useful information to public health authorities for situational awareness and calibration of mitigation strategies.","2010-11","2020-04-08 00:13:50","2020-04-08 00:13:50","2020-04-08 00:13:50","842-846","","6","21","","Epidemiology","The effective reproduction number of pandemic influenza","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20805752 PMCID: PMC3084966","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\EN7FS24A\Cowling et al. - 2010 - The effective reproduction number of pandemic infl.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3084966/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ELIGIBLE DATA: Countries and US states or major cities with at least 250 COVID-19 deaths as of 4/4/2020 and with information available on death counts according to age strata, allowing to calculate the number of deaths in people with age &lt;65. Data were available for Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, as well as Louisiana, Michigan, Washington states and New York City as of April 4, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of COVID-19 deaths that occur in people &lt;65 years old; relative risk of COVID-19 death in people &lt;65 versus ≥65 years old; absolute risk of death in people &lt;65 and in those ≥80 years old in the general population as of 4/4/2020; absolute death risk expressed as equivalent of death risk from driving a motor vehicle. RESULTS: Individuals with age &lt;65 account for 5%-9% of all COVID-19 deaths in the 8 European epicenters, and approach 30% in three US hotbed locations. People &lt;65 years old had 34- to 73-fold lower risk than those ≥65 years old in the European countries and 13- to 15-fold lower risk in New York City, Louisiana and Michigan. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death ranged from 1.7 per million for people &lt;65 years old in Germany to 79 per million in New York City. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people ≥80 years old ranged from approximately 1 in 6,000 in Germany to 1 in 420 in Spain. The COVID-19 death risk in people &lt;65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the death risk from driving between 9 miles per day (Germany) and 415 miles per day (New York City). People &lt;65 years old and not having any underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.3%, 0.7%, and 1.8% of all COVID-19 deaths in Netherlands, Italy, and New York City. CONCLUSIONS: People &lt;65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in the hotbeds of the pandemic and deaths for people &lt;65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic.</p>","2020-04-08","2020-04-09 07:00:04","2020-04-09 07:00:04","2020-04-09 07:00:04","2020.04.05.20054361","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.</p>","2020-03-13","2020-03-19 06:20:17","2020-03-19 06:20:17","2020-03-19 06:20:17","","","0","0","","The Lancet","COVID-19 and Italy","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 32178769","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LVA2JVE8\remuzzi_remuzzi_2020_covid-19_and_italy.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\36YGM69U\fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32178769","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines (‘lock-downs’) that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.","2020-03-31","2020-04-04 04:18:05","2020-04-04 04:18:05","2020-04-04 04:18:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

On the relationship between income and the body mass index","Economics and Human Biology","","1873-6130","10.1016/j.ehb.2011.07.004","","Contrary to conventional wisdom, NHANES data indicate that the poor have never had a statistically significant higher prevalence of overweight status at any time in the last 35 years. Despite this empirical evidence, the view that the poor are less healthy in terms of excess accumulation of fat persists. This paper provides evidence that conventional wisdom is reflecting important differences in the relationship between income and the body mass index. The first finding is based on distribution-sensitive measures of overweight which indicates that the severity of overweight has been higher for the poor than the nonpoor throughout the last 35 years. The second finding is from a newly introduced estimator, unconditional quantile regression (UQR), which provides a measure of the income-gradient in BMI at different points on the unconditional BMI distribution. The UQR estimator indicates that the strongest relationship between income and BMI is observed at the tails of the distribution. There is a statistically significant negative income gradient in BMI at the obesity threshold and some evidence of a positive gradient at the underweight threshold. Both of these UQR estimates imply that for those at the tails of the BMI distribution, increases in income are correlated with healthier BMI values.","2011-12","2020-04-04 03:49:49","2020-04-04 03:49:49","","342-355","","4","9","","Econ Hum Biol","Overweight and poor?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 21816691","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\Q28AJ3HQ\jolliffe_2011_overweight_and_poor.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21816691","","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; United States; Health Surveys; Young Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Overweight; Poverty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. Exposure(s): COVID-19. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6. Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of","","2020-03-30 04:11:54","2020-03-30 04:11:54","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\HRFZ5BC8\Covid - Forecasting COVID-19 impact on hospital bed-days, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then introduce multiple selection nodes to represent the various stages of the survey data collection process in line with the Total Survey Error approach as the dominant conceptual foundation for studying survey errors.

However, the wide adoption of WGS also poses challenges due to the amount of data generated and the need to transform raw data prior to analysis. This complexity means that public health agencies may need more advanced computational infrastructure, a broader technical workforce, and new approaches to data management and stewardship. As both a guide for how this development could occur, and a place to initiate discussion, we describe ten proposals for developing and supporting an informatics infrastructure for public health.","2020-01-11","2020-03-28 22:51:51","2020-04-17 09:44:33","2020-03-28 22:51:51","","","","","","","","","","","","other","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.20944/preprints202001.0107.v1","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\A428KA29\Black et al. - 2020 - Ten Recommendations for Supporting Open Pathogen G.pdf","","genomics; not covid specific; data analysis; recommendation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, χ = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, χ = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.","2020-02-28","2020-03-28 02:25:47","2020-03-28 02:25:47","","","","","","","Chin. Med.

In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. Methods and Findings We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU), given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest, assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented, that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31st January, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards and ICU would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved. Conclusion The health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. This calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission measures (e.g., closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal","2020-01-28","2020-03-26 07:41:47","2020-03-26 07:41:47","2020-03-26 07:41:47","","","","","","","Breaking down of the healthcare system","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.01.27.922443","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\BKDZ3539\Ming et al. - 2020 - Breaking down of the healthcare system Mathematic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model is calibrated to reproduce several characteristics of COVID-19 transmission, accounting for its reproductive number, the length of incubation and generation periods, age-dependent attack rates, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence during a sustained and unmitigated local transmission. An important calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction for adults. We then apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits. We report an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13-14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.","2020-03-23","2020-03-26 01:47:10","2020-03-26 01:47:10","2020-03-26 01:47:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2003.10218","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DWL9GNKG\2003.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\YGSP7UWF\chang_et_al_2020_modelling_transmission_and_control_of_the_covid-19_pandemic_in_australia.pdf","","","Computer Science - Multiagent Systems; Quantitative Biology - Populations and Evolution; Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous estimates of 250 000–500 000 annual influenza deaths are outdated. We updated the estimated number of global annual influenza-associated respiratory deaths using country-specific influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates from 1999–2015.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We estimated country-specific influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rates (EMR) for 33 countries using time series log-linear regression models with vital death records and influenza surveillance data. To extrapolate estimates to countries without data, we divided countries into three analytic divisions for three age groups (<65 years, 65–74 years, and ≥75 years) using WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE) respiratory infection mortality rates. We calculated mortality rate ratios (MRR) to account for differences in risk of influenza death across countries by comparing GHE respiratory infection mortality rates from countries without EMR estimates with those with estimates. To calculate death estimates for individual countries within each age-specific analytic division, we multiplied randomly selected mean annual EMRs by the country's MRR and population. Global 95% credible interval (CrI) estimates were obtained from the posterior distribution of the sum of country-specific estimates to represent the range of possible influenza-associated deaths in a season or year. We calculated influenza-associated deaths for children younger than 5 years for 92 countries with high rates of mortality due to respiratory infection using the same methods.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>EMR-contributing countries represented 57% of the global population. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory EMR ranged from 0·1 to 6·4 per 100 000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2·9 to 44·0 per 100 000 individuals for people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 17·9 to 223·5 per 100 000 for people older than 75 years. We estimated that 291 243–645 832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths (4·0–8·8 per 100 000 individuals) occur annually. The highest mortality rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (2·8–16·5 per 100 000 individuals), southeast Asia (3·5–9·2 per 100 000 individuals), and among people aged 75 years or older (51·3–99·4 per 100 000 individuals). For 92 countries, we estimated that among children younger than 5 years, 9243–105 690 influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>These global influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates are higher than previously reported, suggesting that previous estimates might have underestimated disease burden. The contribution of non-respiratory causes of death to global influenza-associated mortality should be investigated.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>None.</p>","2018-03-31","2020-03-25 21:42:20","2020-03-25 21:42:20","2020-03-25 21:42:20","1285-1300","","10127","391","","The Lancet","Estimates of global seasonal influenza-associated respiratory mortality","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 29248255","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\7U2AXMCV\iuliano_et_al_2018_estimates_of_global_seasonal_influenza-associated_respiratory_mortality.pdf; ; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\QKMC99G5\fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248255","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The universe of the study was China. The major objective was to critical review the present situation of corona virus in China. Total 14 articles were downloaded from the net and 10 to 20 times reads and conclusion was draw about this virus in China. The study indicates that Corona was spread from the Hunan Seafood market Wuhan Province and then spread in the whole world as SARS and MERS. Few cases by doctor in the start was identified in December in 2019 but the government has considered rumor in the country and warning were given to Doctor which was latter on died by this virus. Due to late advertisement by media the virus spread in the whole world and transfered to 33 countries which affected different number. The highest number was found in China 78966 followed by Diamond Princess where number of affectee was 691 while South Korea number was 602. The total death number was 2468 which was so high number than the SARS and MERS. Through this way the economy of China was highly damaged and countries boundaries were sealed while in and out were closed. Mostly the province of Wuhan and Hoebi were highly affected where the death number was 81 percent of the whole number. Canada, United stated and WHO helped in virus controlling. They give huge funds to China. The virus story is very complicated and the diagnosed was difficult. The shape of the virus was like crown while crown mean Corona, So its name was called corona. This virus has different form SARS, Ebola, Flu, MERS and Influenza. All were dangerous for body of human and all attacked mostly in the season of winter and damage the lungs and other tissue of the body. The virus is live in the body of bat but the immunity power is high and it cannot damage to bats. Similarly SARS and MERS live in the body of Covit and Camel while it do not damage to them. The main reason is temperature and immunity. So it is necessary for world expert to analyze the situation and check the temperature and immunity role in Corona virus control. All virus of flu, Ebola, SARS and MERS attacked in the winter season. So it is also necessary to keep the body of the affected person warm for this virus controlling. The bat and camel body temperature is also high, so there the virus affection is nil. Do the experiment on bat, camel and Covit why the virus do not affect their body On the basis of problems the review recommend that to keep the body of the affected person warm for its controlling; When touch animals then wash your hand with soap; Quarantine should be follow and keep constant in the country market; New hospital should be made for proper treatment; Face mask should be made in large number in the country; When some cases appeared then in time reported to concerned department for its treatment; Use more vegetables in daily life; Social talk should be closed when someone is affected by corona virus; All meat food should be cooked nicely. More fund should be kept for health problems solution in the country; Always speak truth and never propagate fake information in the world.; Always kept eye on animal and wash your hand in the time of animal contact.","2020-02-23","2020-03-25 20:42:24","2020-03-25 20:42:24","2020-03-25 20:42:24","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.3543177","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3M6DVE4V\papers.html","","","China; Corona Virus; Critical Review; Present Situation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3543177","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.  Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level.  Results   The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January.  Conclusion   Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","2020-02-23","2020-03-25 09:09:55","2020-04-18 07:27:36","2020-03-25 09:09:55","","","","","","","Evolving epidemiology of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 and possible interruption of local transmission outside Hubei Province in China","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","tex.ids: zhang_evolving_2020-1 DOI: 10.1101/2020.02.21.20026328","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\C8DLAK8Q\Zhang et al. - 2020 - Evolving epidemiology of novel coronavirus disease.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\FWHJF5I9\Zhang et al. - 2020 - Evolving epidemiology of novel coronavirus disease.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such measures. While a constrained form of consequentialism might provide a justification for such public health interventions, we argue that a stronger justification is provided by a principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue: a state may permissibly compel individuals to engage in activities that entail a small cost to them but a large benefit to others, because individuals have a moral duty of easy rescue to engage in those activities. The principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue gives rise to an Obligation Enforcement Requirement: the state should create the conditions such that submitting to coercive or compulsive measures becomes a fundamental moral duty of individuals, i.e. a duty of easy rescue. When the state can create such conditions, it has the strongest justification possible for implementing coercive or compulsive measures, because individuals have a moral duty to temporarily relinquish the rights that such measures would infringe. Our argument has significant implications for how public health emergencies in the developing world should be tackled. Where isolation and quarantine measures are necessary, states or the international community have a moral obligation to provide certain benefits to those quarantined or isolated.","2018","2020-03-25 08:36:28","2020-03-25 08:36:28","2020-03-25 08:36:28","182-189","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Authors Developing World Bioethics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/dewb.12165","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6S8PMJ3H\giubilini_et_al_2018_quarantine,_isolation_and_the_duty_of_easy_rescue_in_public_health.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3CJ6CHPF\dewb.html","","","isolation; public health; easy rescue; quarantine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. Its origin is in the early 20th century, with an important early work being that of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.The models are usually investigated through ordinary differential equations (which are deterministic), but can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which is more realistic but also more complicated to analyze. Compartmental models may be used to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example the prevalence (total number of infected) or the duration of an epidemic. Also, the model allows for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.","2020-03-24","2020-03-25 07:47:11","2020-03-25 07:47:11","2020-03-25 07:47:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 947158682","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GQV2BD3J\index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Critical care capacity has long been needed in the developing world, and efforts to improve the care of the critically ill in these settings are starting to occur. Expansion of critical care to handle the consequences of an ageing population, natural disasters, conflict, inadequate primary care, and higher-risk medical therapies will be challenged by high costs at a time of economic constraint.

We categorized regions into quartiles of bed change over the study interval and examined the relationship between change categories, regional characteristics, and population characteristics over time., Measurements and Main Results: From 2000 to 2009 the national number of ICU beds increased 15%, from 67,579 to 77,809, mirroring population. However, there was substantial regional variation in absolute changes (median, +16 ICU beds; interquartile range, −3 to +51) and population-adjusted changes (median, +0.9 ICU beds per 100,000; interquartile range, −3.8 to +5.9), with 25.0% of regions accounting for 74.8% of overall growth. At baseline, regions with increasing numbers of ICU beds had larger populations, lower ICU beds per 100,000 capita, higher average ICU occupancy, and greater market competition as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (P < 0.001 for all comparisons)., Conclusions: National trends in ICU bed growth are not uniformly reflected at the regional level, with most growth occurring in a small number of highly populated regions.","2015-02-15","2020-03-23 07:33:22","2020-03-23 07:33:22","2020-03-23 07:33:22","410-416","","4","191","","Am J Respir Crit Care Med","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25522054 PMCID: PMC4351597","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\SANVKWBR\wallace_et_al_2015_critical_care_bed_growth_in_the_united_states.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351597/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic.

It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to help develop informed public health strategies. Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases ‘imported’ directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no successful intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474). Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.","2020-03-08","2020-03-21 09:22:16","2020-03-21 09:22:16","2020-03-21 09:22:16","","","","","","","Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.06.20031880","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6K4E8VQV\Li et al. - 2020 - Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the U.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in this issue of BMJ Quality and Safety , Lynch et al 6 question the merits of distinguishing ACSCs from other emergency admissions. Examining factors associated with county-level variation in emergency admissions in Ireland, they found similar factors were associated with both all emergency admissions and ACSCs. Lynch and colleagues concluded that ‘the distinction between potentially avoidable and all other emergency admissions may not be as useful as previously believed’.6  Here, we discuss the value of using ACSCs. We argue that they give important information on potentially avoidable demand for healthcare, but can only be used as an effective indicator after accounting for the drivers of demand for care that are common to all hospital admissions. Further, to reduce potentially avoidable emergency admissions, we must understand the mechanisms which link population factors such as deprivation to higher ACSC admission rates. In addition to understanding demand, ACSCs can provide indirect insights into the quality of ambulatory care provided, although it is important to recognise that they do not capture all facets of high quality care. Policy makers generally seek to reduce emergency hospital admission rates (ie, where a patient is admitted to hospital urgently and the admission is unplanned). Emergency admissions to hospitals carry risks to patients; for vulnerable patients, even short admissions can lead to infection, loss of mobility or increased frailty from inactivity.

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening.

CONCLUSIONS In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

Yet people encounter critical inner psychological barriers to compassion that limit the effectiveness of compassion training—including the lack of a secure base, aversion to suffering, feeling alone in suffering, and reductive impressions of others. These barriers emerge, in part, from a lack of relational support and are exacerbated by modernist conceptions that present meditation as an autonomous, self-help practice. This article proposes a solution centered on relationality, derived from the integration of diverse areas of psychology with contemplative traditions. Theories and findings from social, developmental, and health psychology can inform meditation programs and help recover important relational elements of compassion training from traditional cultures that address common barriers to compassion, and thus promote more sustainable and inclusive care. In so doing, this paper illustrates the value of psychological theories for translating important contextual elements from contemplative traditions into diverse modern settings.","2019-11-20","2020-04-09 22:08:24","2020-04-09 22:08:24","2020-04-09 22:08:24","","","","","","","Recovering the relational starting point of compassion training","","","","","MindRxiv","","","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.31231/osf.io/dmxj7","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\JC6ENXIW\condon_makransky_2019_recovering_the_relational_starting_point_of_compassion_training.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In general, an epidemic is the occurrence of cases of an illness in excess of normal expectancy. The investigation of an epidemic often demands a number of sequential studies: first descriptive, then aetiological. Clusters consist of an increase in incidence of much smaller magnitude, perhaps excluding the possibility that this is merely a result of chance. In recent years, more valid statistical methods for the assessment of clusters have developed. For interstitial lung disease in particular, different classifications exist that are sometimes inconsistent and may change with time. All diseases require a process of ascertainment, whereby they are identified, classified and perhaps registered. The two most employed epidemiological techniques for testing aetiological hypotheses are the cohort and case-referent approaches.","2001-07-01","2020-04-16 03:43:39","2020-04-16 03:43:39","2020-04-16 03:43:39","101s-106s","","32 suppl","18","","","Clusters, classification and epidemiology of interstitial lung diseases","","","","","","","en","© ERS Journals Ltd","","","","erj.ersjournals.com","","Publisher: European Respiratory Society Section: Original Articles PMID: 11816815","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6QSUHM73\Antó and Cullinan - 2001 - Clusters, classification and epidemiology of inter.pdf; ; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ARGBCF4T\101s.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11816815","","classification of interstitial lung disease; cluster; cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis; epidemics; epidemiological techniques; sarcoidosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a discrete time spatial simulation model we tested the effect of host clustering on transmission of infection within a population. Over a large parameter range, an optimum cluster size was observed to ensure maximum probability of escaping infection. Although the within cluster transmission increased with cluster size, the between cluster distance increased thereby decreasing the probability of transmission across clusters. The probability of stochastic extinction of the pathogen also increased with increasing cluster size. Thus contrary to the popular belief, clustering can be an effective strategy to minimize the risk of infections.","1997-01-21","2020-04-16 03:45:07","2020-04-16 03:45:07","2020-04-16 03:45:07","165-169","","2","184","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","Epidemic Diseases and Host Clustering","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\5PGPFERF\S0022519396902672.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods for the detection and testing for apparent clusters of disease, including those near a possible environmental hazard, are reviewed. Estimating regional mortality rates, possibly to construct disease maps, and methods for investigating the association between disease rates and social, demographic and environmental factors are discussed. In addition, statistical analysis of the spatial spread of epidemics is mentioned.","1991-05-01","2020-04-16 04:36:25","2020-04-16 04:36:25","2020-04-16 04:36:25","421-441","","3","154","","Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society)","","","","","","","","","","","","","rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VR5NXX2P\2983152.html","","","bayesian mapping; disease clustering; disease mapping: disease rates; ecological analysis; empirical bayes estimation; environmental hazard; spatial autocorrelation; spatial dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LXQG78UP","journalArticle","","Nolan, D; Speed, T P","Teaching Statistics Theory Through Applications","","","","","","In this paper we present a model for developing case studies, or labs, for use in undergraduate mathematical statistics courses. The model proposed here is to design labs that are more in-depth than most examples in statistical texts, by providing rich background material, investigations and analyses in the context of a scientiﬁc problem, and detailed theoretical development within the lab. An important goal of this approach is to encourage and develop statistical thinking. It is also advocated that the labs be made the center piece of the theoretical course. As a result, the curriculum, lectures, and assignments are signiﬁcantly restructured. For example, the course work includes written assignments based on open-ended data analyses, and the lectures include group work and discussions of the case-studies.","","2020-04-17 00:54:08","2020-04-17 00:54:08","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\K7YIRI3T\Nolan and Speed - Teaching Statistics Theory Through Applications.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The workshop offered a unique opportunity for practitioners in the ﬁelds of telemedicine and shared care to discuss the legal, ethical and risk issues arising from the practice of medicine and healthcare from a distance using information and communication technologies (‘ICTs’) with a panel of experts from the ﬁelds of medicine, law, insurance and risk management. There was a broad consensus that many of the legal and ethical issues raised by those who dislike the idea of treating distant patients were not speciﬁc to telemedicine but to medicine and healthcare in general. It was agreed, however, that in those areas where telemedicine does create new clinical risks and responsibilities a much more proactive role should be taken by the professional associations and Royal Colleges in providing better education and guidance to their members about the practical and professional issues that will inevitably arise from the evolution of ‘Hospitals Without Walls’. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

First, attention should be paid not only to non-analytical and/or mindfulness-based practices, but to a fuller range of contemplative practices, including analytical styles of meditation. Second, the issue of ethics must be addressed as a framework within which to understand contemplative practice: both theoretically in order to understand better the practices themselves and the traditions they come from, and practically in order to understand the ways in which contemplative practices are deployed in contemporary societies. The Tibetan Buddhist Lojong (blo sbyong) tradition and secularized practices derived from it, which are now an area of study in contemplative science, are examined as a kind of case study in order to make these two points and illustrate their importance and relevance for the future of this emerging ﬁeld.","2016","2020-04-17 00:41:27","2020-04-17 00:41:27","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\Y334BCZ4\Silva - 2016 - Contemplative Science and Secular Ethics.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low socioeconomic status, especially lack of education, also is a risk factor for diabetes. Therefore, we assessed the association of education and smoking status, including ETS exposure, with the prevalence of diabetes. Methods: Data were from the 2007–2013 Korea National Health and Nutritional Evaluation Survey (KNHANES). Multivariable logistic regression examined associations between various lifestyle and health factors and prevalence of diabetes while controlling for potential confounding variables. Subgroup analysis was performed according to smoking status to determine factors associated with diabetes. Results: Of 19,303 individuals analyzed, 1,325 (11.4%) had diabetes. Greater average age, male sex, lower educational level, unemployment, and coexisting health problems were significantly associated with diabetes. Individuals with only elementary, middle, or high school level education had significantly greater odds ratios (p<0.05) compared to college graduates; smokers and nonsmokers exposed to ETS had significantly greater OR (p<0.05) than nonsmokers unexposed to ETS. Subgroup analysis of diabetics according to smoking status revealed significant associations (p<0.05) for diabetic nonsmokers exposed to ETS with female sex, single status, elementary level education, urban residence, National Health Insurance (NHI), hypertension, no alcohol intake, and no moderate physical activity. For diabetic smokers, there were significant associations (p<0.05) with elementary education, urban residence, lack of moderate physical activity, no alcohol intake, and NHI. Conclusions: The results suggested that smoking status, including ETS exposure, was associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes especially in populations with less education. Thus, we should direct efforts for controlling diabetes toward individuals with lower levels of education, and those who are smokers and nonsmokers exposed to ETS.","2017","2020-04-17 00:39:14","2020-04-17 00:39:14","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\L8K4ZDG9\Kim et al. - 2017 - Association of Education and Smoking Status on Ris.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.","2017-12-18","2020-04-17 00:36:14","2020-04-17 00:36:15","2020-04-17 00:36:14","e142","","","3","","","Sustainable computational science","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\UUNIUDLV\Rougier et al. - 2017 - Sustainable computational science the ReScience i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We calculate visit rates by age and other demographic characteristics and assess mode of arrival and disposition. Results are presented with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs). Results: From 1992 to 2001, epistaxis occurred at 4,503,000 ED visits, or 0.46% (95% CI 0.41% to 0.51%) of all visits. Per 1,000 population, 1.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 1.9) ED visits for epistaxis occurred annually. The age-related frequency was bimodal, with peaks among those younger than 10 years (4.0 per 1,000 visits) and aged 70 to 79 years (12.0 per 1,000 visits). Most cases (83%; 95% CI 80% to 86%) were atraumatic. Traumatic cases were younger than atraumatic cases (mean age 31 versus 49 years). From December to February, atraumatic epistaxis occurred in 0.50% (95% CI 0.40% to 0.60%) of all visits versus 0.34% (95% CI 0.30% to 0.39%) during nonwinter months. Fifteen percent (95% CI 12% to 18%) of cases arrived by ambulance, and 6% (95% CI 5% to 7%) of patients were hospitalized. Conclusion: Epistaxis accounts for about 1 in 200 ED visits in the United States. Although there is an early age peak (age O10 years), the frequency increases from age 20 years onward, with the highest rates in the elderly. Epistaxis visits are more common in the winter. Future efforts to decrease epistaxis visits might focus on education of the elderly and parents of young children about nasal mucosa care and basic approaches to home management.

However, beyond the simple encouragement to “work harder,” “write more,” and “publish more,” not much direction is given to junior scholars regarding how they should think about and manage their research pipeline. How does one develop a large number of papers from their ﬁrst stages to the pages of respected journals? This article discusses the author’s system for pipeline management.

We measure the genetic predisposition of siblings to educational attainment using polygenic scores. We then test how polygenic scores are related to social environments and educational outcomes. In Add Health, genetic predisposition to educational attainment is patterned across the social environment. Participants with higher polygenic scores were more likely to grow up in socially advantaged families. Even so, the previously published genetic associations appear to be causal. Among pairs of siblings, the sibling with the higher polygenic score typically went on to complete more years of schooling as compared to their lowerscored co-sibling.

However, unlike other major sciences, its theoretical foundations are rarely articulated. While the idea of epidemiologic theory may seem dry and arcane, it is at its core about explaining the people's health. It is about life and death. It is about biology and society. It is about ecology and the economy. It is about how myriad aspects of people's lives--involving work, dignity, desire, love, play, conflict, discrimination, and injustice--become literally incorporated biologically into our bodies and manifest in our health status, individually and collectively. And it is about essential knowledge critical for improving the people's health and minimizing inequitable burdens of disease, disability, and death. Woven from a vast array of schools of thought, including those in the natural, social, and biomedical sciences, epidemiologic theory is a rich tapestry whose time for analysis is long overdue. By tracing its history and contours from ancient societies on through the development of--and debates within--contemporary epidemiology worldwide, Nancy Krieger shows how epidemiologic theory has long shaped epidemiologic practice, knowledge, and the politics of public health. Outlining an ecosocial theory of disease distribution that situates both population health and epidemiologic theory in societal and ecologic context, she offers a more holistic picture of how we embody the human experience""--Provided by publisher","2011","2020-04-17 03:31:11","2020-04-17 03:31:11","","","381","","","","","Epidemiology and the people's health","","","","","Oxford University Press","New York","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","RA651 .K75 2011","OCLC: ocn685111261","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\Y5S4AN5S\Krieger - 2011 - Epidemiology and the people's health theory and c.pdf","","","Epidemiology; Epidemiologic Methods; Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, a review of 398 empirical articles and 41 unpublished dissertations that employ marker variables indicates that authors are not reporting adequate information regarding marker variable choice and use, are choosing inappropriate marker variables, and are possibly making errors in their assessment of CMV effects. Second, two data sets are presented that investigate the properties of six prospective markers to assess the degree to which they capture specific, measurable causes of CMV and the conclusions these markers produce when applied to substantive relationships. Results from the review and empirical investigation are used to expand the set of conditions scholars should consider when determining whether to employ a marker technique over other alternatives for detecting and controlling CMV and how best to do so.","","2020-04-17 02:36:20","2020-04-17 02:36:20","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\BGGL32NY\Simmering et al. - Marker Variable Choice, Reporting, and Interpretat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I document that inter-state migrants within India consume fewer calories per Rupee of food expenditure compared to their non-migrant neighbors, even for households with very low caloric intake. I then provide two pieces of evidence in support of an explanation based on culture: that migrants make nutritionally-suboptimal food choices due to strong preferences for the traditional foods of their origin states. First, I document that migrants bring their origin-state food preferences with them when they migrate. Second, I show that the gap in caloric intake between locals and migrants is related to the suitability and intensity of these origin-state food preferences: the most adversely affected migrants (households in which both husband and wife migrated to a village where their origin-state preferences are unsuited to the local price vector) would consume 7 percent more calories if they possessed the same preferences as their neighbors.","","2020-04-18 04:04:51","2020-04-18 04:04:51","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\SE4WMX3Z\Atkin - The Caloric Cost of Culture Evidence from Indian .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For scientific software, however, this is less often the case. Most scientific software is written by only a few authors, often a student working on a thesis. Once the paper describing the tool has been published, the tool is no longer developed further and is left to its own device. Here we describe the broad, multidisciplinary community we formed around a set of tools for statistical genomics. The GenABEL project for statistical omics actively promotes open interdisciplinary development of statistical methodology and its implementation in efficient and user-friendly software under an open source licence. The software tools developed withing the project collectively make up the GenABEL suite, which currently consists of eleven tools. The open framework of the project actively encourages involvement of the community in all stages, from formulation of methodological ideas to application of software to specific data sets. A web forum is used to channel user questions and discussions, further promoting the use of the GenABEL suite. Developer discussions take place on a dedicated mailing list, and development is further supported by robust development practices including use of public version control, code review and continuous integration. Use of this open science model attracts contributions from users and developers outside the “core team”, facilitating agile statistical omics methodology development and fast dissemination.","2016-05-19","2020-04-18 04:03:44","2020-04-18 04:03:44","2020-04-18 04:03:44","914","","","5","","F1000Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\CJHR376Q\Karssen et al. - 2016 - The GenABEL Project for statistical genomics.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As it can be suspended over long time and travel over long distances in the atmosphere, it can cause a wide range of diseases that lead to a signiﬁcant reduction of human life. The size of particles has been directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Small particles of concern include “inhalable coarse particles” with a diameter of 2.5 to 10 μm and “ﬁne particles” smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter. As the source–effect relationship of PM remains unclear, it is not easy to deﬁne such effects from individual sources such as longrange transport of pollution. Because of the potent role of PM and its associated pollutants, detailed knowledge of their human health impacts is of primary importance. This paper summarizes the basic evidence on the health effects of particulate matter. An in-depth analysis is provided to address the implications for policy-makers so that more stringent strategies can be implemented to reduce air pollution and its health effects.","2015-01","2020-04-18 04:02:44","2020-04-18 04:02:44","2020-04-18 04:02:44","136-143","","","74","","Environment International","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\WBA5A3QP\Kim et al. - 2015 - A review on the human health impact of airborne pa.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The genome-wide association scan (GWAS) era of genetic epidemiology has generated a massive amount of data, revolutionized our thinking on the genetic architecture of common diseases and positioned the field to realistically consider risk prediction for common polygenic diseases, such as non-familial cancers, and autoimmune, cardiovascular, and psychiatric diseases. Polygenic scoring is an approach that shows promise for understanding the polygenic contribution to common human diseases. This is an approach typically relying on genome-wide SNP data, where a set of SNPs identified in a discovery GWAS are used to construct composite polygenic scores. These scores are then used in additional samples for association testing or risk prediction. This review summarizes the extant literature on the use, power, and accuracy of polygenic scores in studies of the etiology of disease and the promise for disease risk prediction.","2015-12","2020-04-18 03:07:57","2020-04-18 03:07:57","2020-04-18 03:07:57","239-244","","4","2","","Curr Epidemiol Rep","Polygenic Scores in Epidemiology","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6SLCQML8\Maher - 2015 - Polygenic Scores in Epidemiology Risk Prediction,.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a machine-learning framework to integrate personal genomes and electronic health record (EHR) data and used this framework to study abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a prevalent irreversible cardiovascular disease with unclear etiology. Performing whole-genome sequencing on AAA patients and controls, we demonstrated its predictive precision solely from personal genomes. By modeling personal genomes with EHRs, this framework quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of adjusting personal lifestyles given personal genome baselines, demonstrating its utility as a personal health management tool. We showed that this new framework agnostically identiﬁed genetic components involved in AAA, which were subsequently validated in human aortic tissues and in murine models. Our study presents a new framework for disease genome analysis, which can be used for both health management and understanding the biological architecture of complex diseases.","2018-09","2020-04-18 03:05:18","2020-04-18 03:05:18","2020-04-18 03:05:18","1361-1372.e10","","6","174","","Cell","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\XHQWPVBQ\Li et al. - 2018 - Decoding the Genomics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three cohorts have been established: the older twin cohort in the 1970s, and the Finntwin12 and Finntwin16 studies initiated in the 1990s. The present review provides on update on the latest data collections conducted since the previous review. These cover the fourth waves of data collection in the older cohort (twins born before 1958) and Finntwin12 (twins born 1983–1987). The ﬁfth wave of data collection in Finntwin16 (twins born 1975–1979) also included assessments of their spouses/partners. An analysis of mortality in the older cohort from 1975 to 2009 indicates that the mortality of adult twins (as individuals) does not differ from the population at large. Based on the cohorts, many sub-studies with more detailed phenotyping and collection of omics data have been conducted or are in progress. We also contribute to numerous national and international collaborations.","2013","2020-04-17 03:55:23","2020-04-17 03:55:23","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VZNKR2RQ\Kaprio - 2013 - The Finnish Twin Cohort Study An Update.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several traditional problems in genetic epidemiology have recently been addressed by assuming a polygenic basis for disease and treating it as a single entity. Here I brieﬂy review some of these applications, which collectively may be termed polygenic epidemiology. Methodologies in this area include polygenic scoring, linear mixed models, and linkage disequilibrium scoring. They have been used to establish a polygenic effect, estimate genetic correlation between traits, estimate how many variants affect a trait, stratify cases into subphenotypes, predict individual disease risks, and infer causal effects using Mendelian randomization. Polygenic epidemiology will continue to yield useful applications even while much of the speciﬁc variation underlying complex traits remains undiscovered.","2016-05","2020-04-18 00:57:06","2020-04-18 00:57:06","2020-04-18 00:57:06","268-272","","4","40","","Genet.

In this type of studies the significance level is very difficult to achieve (5 × 10− 8) due to multiple testing. Thus, the identified variants only explain a small fraction of the genetic risk. It is expected that hundreds of thousands of variants also confer an increased risk but do not reach significance levels. One way to capture this information is by constructing a Polygenic Risk Score. Polygenic Risk Score has been widely used with success in genetics studies within neuropsychiatric disorders. The use of polygenic scores is highly relevant as data from a large migraine GenomeWide Association Study are now available, which will form an excellent basis for Polygenic Risk Score in migraine studies. Results: Polygenic Risk Score has been used in studies of neuropsychiatric disorders to assess prediction of disease status in case-control studies, shared genetic correlation between co-morbid diseases, and shared genetic correlation between a disease and specific endophenotypes. Conclusion: Polygenic Risk Score provides an opportunity to investigate the shared genetic risk between known and previously unestablished co-morbidities in migraine research, and may lead to better and personalized treatment of migraine if used as a clinical assistant when identifying responders to specific drugs. Polygenic Risk Score can be used to analyze the genetic relationship between different headache types and migraine endophenotypes. Finally, Polygenic Risk Score can be used to assess pharmacogenetic effects, and perhaps help to predict efficacy of the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide monoclonal antibodies that soon become available as migraine treatment.","2018-12","2020-04-18 00:46:28","2020-04-18 00:46:28","2020-04-18 00:46:28","29","","1","19","","J Headache Pain","Polygenic risk score","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\U5KDGM5I\Chalmer et al. - 2018 - Polygenic risk score use in migraine research.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A rare monogenic mutation associated with increased cholesterol is present in ~1:250 carriers and confers an up to 4-fold increase in coronary risk when compared with non-carriers. Although individual common polymorphisms have modest predictive capacity, their cumulative impact can be aggregated into a polygenic score. Here, we develop a new, genome-wide polygenic score that aggregates information from 6.6 million common polymorphisms and show that this score can similarly identify individuals with a 4-fold increased risk for coronary disease. In >400,000 participants from UK Biobank, the score conforms to a normal distribution and those in the top 2.5% of the distribution are at 4-fold increased risk compared to the remaining 97.5%. Similar patterns are observed with genome-wide polygenic scores for two additional diseases – breast cancer and severe obesity.","2017-11-15","2020-04-18 00:44:13","2020-04-18 00:44:14","2020-04-18 00:44:13","","","","","","","","","","","","Genomics","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/218388","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\9A27GLHD\Khera et al. - 2017 - Genome-wide polygenic score to identify a monogeni.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present an SECIR compartmental mathematical model, with the population divided into age classes, for the transmission of HBV using local data on incidence of infection and vaccination coverage. We estimate the basic reproduction number, R0, to be 1.53, and show that the vaccination campaign has substantially reduced this below one. However, a large number of carriers remain in the population acting as a source of infection.","2011-01","2020-04-18 00:31:55","2020-04-18 00:31:55","2020-04-18 00:31:55","266-272","","1","269","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\Q84TCTZ6\Mann and Roberts - 2011 - Modelling the epidemiology of hepatitis B in New Z.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brassica juncea (Indian mustard) plants grown in Hg-contaminated Tui mine tailings (New Zealand) were enclosed in gastight volatilisation chambers to investigate the eﬀect of ammonium thiosulphate ([NH4]2S2O3) on the plant-Hg volatilisation process. Application of (NH4)2S2O3 to substrates increased up to 6 times the Hg concentration in shoots and roots of B. juncea relative to controls. Volatilisation rates were signiﬁcantly higher in plants irrigated only with water (control) when compared to plants treated with (NH4)2S2O3. Volatilisation from barren pots (without plants) indicated that Hg in tailings is subject to biological and photochemical reactions. Addition of sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3) at 5 g/kg of substrate to B. juncea plants grown at the Tui mine site conﬁrmed the plant growth chambers studies showing the eﬀectiveness of thio-solutions at enhancing shoot Hg concentrations. Mercury extraction from the ﬁeld plots yielded a maximum value of 25 g/ha. Mass balance studies revealed that volatilisation is a dominant pathway for Hg removal from the Tui mine site. A preliminary assessment of the risks of volatilisation indicated that enhanced Hg emissions by plants would not harm the local population and the regional environment.","2005-07","2020-04-18 00:31:42","2020-04-18 00:31:42","2020-04-18 00:31:41","341-352","","2","136","","Environmental Pollution","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\N693QA6X\Moreno et al. - 2005 - Mercury volatilisation and phytoextraction from ba.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, elements of discursive democracy introduced by the legislation have subsequently been impaired by technocorporatist legal formalism. This has prompted considerable debate about the perceived high process and compliance costs and the restricted public scrutiny of effects-based compliance in the new planning system. The reduced emphasis on socioeconomic effects within land-use development plans has impeded the promotion of sustainable spatial development strategies, frustrating attempts to deliver the `superindustrial ecological switchover' sought by proponents of ecological modernisation.

It draws on qualitative research into a Sydney-based sustainable living programme called ‘GreenHome’, to examine how participants’ environmental ethics became articulated through objects’ use. This forges a form of embodied ‘techno-ethics’ that permeates socio-material relations beyond the immediate.

Data extraction Myocardial infarction, death, cardiovascular death, angina pectoris, stroke, heart failure, and new onset diabetes. Results 37 randomised clinical trials included 147 020 participants and had a total follow-up of 485 166 patient years. When compared with controls (placebo/active treatment), placebo, or active treatment, angiotensin receptor blockers were not associated with an increase in the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.07), death, cardiovascular death, or angina pectoris.

The most sought after locations boast a scenic landscape right outside their window. No matter what the scene – mountains, skyscrapers, clouds, or pastureland – clarity and vividness are essential to the image. Air pollution can degrade scenic vistas, and in extreme cases, completely obscure them. Particulate matter suspended in the air is the main cause of visibility degradation. Particulate matter affects visibility in multiple ways: obscures distant objects, drains the contrast from a scene, and discolors the sky. Visibility is an environmental quality that is valued for aesthetic reasons that are difﬁcult to express or quantify. Human psychology and physiology are sensitive to visual input. Visibility has been monitored throughout the world but there are few places where it is a protected resource. Existing health-based regulations are weak in terms of visibility protection. Various techniques, including human observation, light transmission measurements, digital photography, and satellite imaging, are used to monitor visibility. As with air pollution, trends in visibility vary spatially and temporally.

Here, we present the result of an epidemiological study (December 1992–August 1995) of feline immunodeﬁciency virus (FIV) in a free-roaming population of domestic cats (Felis catus), with a special emphasis on sample bias. Over ﬁve trapping periods, the prevalence of FIV in sampled cats steadily declined. Across these samples we consistently achieved a very large sampling fraction (approximately 60% of the population), the sex ratio, age and weight distributions remained stable with time in the samples, and the sex ratio was similar in the samples and the population. These indices would normally indicate that our samples were representative, suggesting the decline in FIV prevalence to be real. However, a concomitant ecological study of the whole population revealed an important bias in the samples, with an initial high probability of capturing a few individuals, which appeared signiﬁcantly more likely to be FIV-infected, and then a lower probability of recapturing them. Since our protocol resulted in a non-random sampling, subsequent trappings were designed to avoid this bias, by also capturing individuals who had previously learned to escape capture. This modiﬁed capture regime revealed that FIV prevalence was in fact constant in the population. This study shows how samples of large size, which are stable and appear representative of the population, can still be biased. These results may have major implications for other studies based on trapping.","2000-01","2020-04-18 00:16:05","2020-04-18 00:16:05","2020-04-18 00:16:05","71-78","","1","36","","Journal of Wildlife Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\IHPF6YHS\Courchamp et al. - 2000 - DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND CORRECTION OF A BIA.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: An ecological time-series study. Total daily records of asthma hospital admissions (ICD 10th J15) were obtained from one of the main hospitals in Araraquara, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, from 23 March 2003 to 27 July 2004. The daily concentration of TSP (mg/m3) was obtained using Handi-vol equipment (Energe´tica, Brazil) placed in downtown Araraquara. The local airport provided the daily mean figures of temperature and humidity. The daily number of asthma hospital admissions was considered as the dependent variable in Poisson’s regression models and the daily concentration of TSP was considered the independent variable. The generalised linear model with natural cubic spline was adopted to control for long-time trend. Linear terms were used for weather variables. Results: TSP had an acute effect on asthma admissions, starting 1 day after TSP concentrations increased and remaining almost unchanged for the next four days. A 10 mg/m3 increase in the 5-day moving average (lag1–5) of TSP concentrations was associated with an increase of 11.6% (95% CI 5.4 to 17.7) in asthma hospital admissions. Conclusion: Increases in TSP concentrations were definitely associated with asthma hospital admissions in Araraquara and, despite using sugar cane alcohol to reduce air pollution from automotive sources in large Brazilian urban centres, the cities where sugar cane is harvested pay a high toll in terms of public health.","2007-05-01","2020-04-18 00:15:58","2020-04-18 00:15:58","2020-04-18 00:15:58","395-400","","5","61","","Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6MSAD29P\Arbex et al. - 2007 - Air pollution from biomass burning and asthma hosp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Survival data are a special type of data, and therefore have to be analyzed with special methods. Methods: We illustrate special techniques for analyzing survival times by applying them to a publication on the treatment of patients with brain tumors. The present article is based on textbooks of statistics, a selective review of the literature, and the authors’ own experience. Results: Survival times are analyzed with the KaplanMeier method, which yields two measures of interest: survival rates and the median survival time. The log-rank test is used to compare survival times across treatment groups. Cox regression is used in multivariable models. The hazard ratio, a descriptive measure for differences in survival times, is explained. Conclusion: If survival times are analyzed without the use of special techniques, or if the underlying assumptions are not taken into account, faulty interpretation may result. Readers of scientific publications should know these pitfalls and be able to judge for themselves whether the chosen analytical method is correct. ►Cite this as: Zwiener I, Blettner M, Hommel G: Survival analysis—part 15 of a series on evaluation of scientific publications.

Genetic atlases reveal pervasive pleiotropy, and genome-wide significant loci are often shared across different phenotypes. We introduce genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM), a multivariate method for analyzing the joint genetic architectures of complex traits. Using formal methods for modeling covariance structure, Genomic SEM synthesizes genetic correlations and SNP-heritabilities inferred from GWAS summary statistics of individual traits from samples with varying and unknown degrees of overlap. Genomic SEM can be used to identify variants with effects on general dimensions of cross-trait liability, boost power for discovery, and calculate more predictive polygenic scores. Finally, Genomic SEM can be used to identify loci that cause divergence between traits, aiding the search for what uniquely differentiates highly correlated phenotypes. We demonstrate several applications of Genomic SEM, including a joint analysis of GWAS summary statistics from five genetically correlated psychiatric traits. We identify 27 independent SNPs not previously identified in the univariate GWASs, 5 of which have been reported in other published GWASs of the included traits. Polygenic scores derived from Genomic SEM consistently outperform polygenic scores derived from GWASs of the individual traits. Genomic SEM is flexible, open ended, and allows for continuous innovations in how multivariate genetic architecture is modeled.","2018-04-21","2020-04-18 00:12:17","2020-04-18 00:12:17","2020-04-18 00:12:17","","","","","","","","","","","","Genetics","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/305029","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\AHVAJN7F\Grotzinger et al. - 2018 - Genomic SEM Provides Insights into the Multivariat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether antiandrogen therapy with radiation therapy will further improve cancer control and prolong overall survival is unknown. METHODS In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1998 through 2003, we assigned 760 eligible patients who had undergone prostatectomy with a lymphadenectomy and had disease, as assessed on pathological testing, with a tumor stage of T2 (confined to the prostate but with a positive surgical margin) or T3 (with histologic extension beyond the prostatic capsule), no nodal involvement, and a detectable PSA level of 0.2 to 4.0 ng per milliliter to undergo radiation therapy and receive either antiandrogen therapy (24 months of bicalutamide at a dose of 150 mg daily) or daily placebo tablets during and after radiation therapy. The primary end point was the rate of overall survival. RESULTS The median follow-up among the surviving patients was 13 years. The actuarial rate of overall survival at 12 years was 76.3% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 71.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.99; P=0.04). The 12-year incidence of death from prostate cancer, as assessed by means of central review, was 5.8% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 13.4% in the placebo group (P<0.001). The cumulative incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at 12 years was 14.5% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 23.0% in the placebo group (P=0.005). The incidence of late adverse events associated with radiation therapy was similar in the two groups. Gynecomastia was recorded in 69.7% of the patients in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 10.9% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001).

The wandering mind is thus a considerable obstacle when attention must be maintained over time. Mental training through meditation has been proposed as an effective method of attenuating the ebb and ﬂow of attention to thoughts and feelings that distract from one’s foremost present goals. We provide evidence from 2 longitudinal studies that intensive meditation training in focused attention and monitoring meditation is associated with attenuated lapses of attention while reading. Across 2 studies, participants completed a reading task requiring ongoing error monitoring to detect episodes of semantic inconsistency. In a preliminary study, training participants were assessed at the beginning and end of a 3-month shamatha meditation retreat and again 7 years later. In a second study, training and experiencematched control participants were assessed at the beginning and end of a 1-month insight meditation retreat. Across both studies, training participants engaged in less mind wandering and less mindless reading following meditation training. Intensive meditation training may promote reductions in mind wandering among practitioners when required to maintain attention during a complex cognitive task.","2016-03","2020-04-17 22:31:42","2020-04-17 22:31:42","2020-04-17 22:31:42","12-33","","1","3","","Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\RS8XHFM4\Zanesco et al. - 2016 - Meditation training influences mind wandering and .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6–10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1–31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4–13% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here.","2016-04-12","2020-04-17 22:17:52","2020-04-17 22:17:52","2020-04-17 22:17:52","4146-4151","","15","113","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\P87PGRS4\Springmann et al. - 2016 - Analysis and valuation of the health and climate c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, we assert that the evidence-based movement in health sciences constitutes a good example of microfascism at play in the contemporary scientiﬁc arena. Objective The philosophical work of Deleuze and Guattari proves to be useful in showing how health sciences are colonised (territorialised) by an all-encompassing scientiﬁc research paradigm – that of post-positivism – but also and foremost in showing the process by which a dominant ideology comes to exclude alternative forms of knowledge, therefore acting as a fascist structure. Conclusion The Cochrane Group, among others, has created a hierarchy that has been endorsed by many academic institutions, and that serves to (re)produce the exclusion of certain forms of research. Because ‘regimes of truth’ such as the evidence-based movement currently enjoy a privileged status, scholars have not only a scientiﬁc duty, but also an ethical obligation to deconstruct these regimes of power.","2006-09","2020-04-17 22:15:15","2020-04-17 22:15:15","2020-04-17 22:15:15","180-186","","3","4","","Int J EB Healthcare","Deconstructing the evidence-based discourse in health sciences","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\XNWV4SHU\Holmes et al. - 2006 - Deconstructing the evidence-based discourse in hea.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has strong roots in biometrical genetic theory, which allows predictions to be made about the correlations between observed traits of identical and fraternal twins in terms of underlying genetic and environmental components. One can infer the relative importance of these ‘latent’ factors (model parameters) by structural equation modelling (SEM) of observed covariances of both twin types. SEM programs estimate model parameters by minimising a goodness-of-ﬁt function between observed and predicted covariance matrices, usually by the maximum-likelihood criterion. Likelihood ratio statistics also allow the comparison of ﬁt of different competing models. The program Mx, speciﬁcally developed to model genetically sensitive data, is now widely used in twin analyses. The ﬂexibility of Mx allows the modelling of multivariate data to examine the genetic and environmental relations between two or more phenotypes and the modelling to categorical traits under liability-threshold models.","2002-01-01","2020-04-17 21:49:30","2020-04-17 21:49:30","2020-04-17 21:49:30","119-133","","2","3","","Briefings in Bioinformatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\42WVXZCT\Rijsdijk - 2002 - Analytic approaches to twin data using structural .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aims of this study are to explore patient perceptions of quality of health care and to understand how perceptions may differ by settings and condition. A systematic review of multiple databases was conducted for studies targeting patient perceptions of quality of care. Two reviewers screened and extracted data independently. Data synthesis was performed following a meta-narrative approach. A total of 36 studies were included that identified 10 quality dimensions perceived by patients: communication, access, shared decision making, provider knowledge and skills, physical environment, patient education, electronic medical record, pain control, discharge process, and preventive services. These dimensions can be used in planning and evaluating health care delivery. Future research should evaluate the effect of interventions targeting patient experience on patient outcomes.","2016","2020-04-18 05:57:54","2020-04-18 06:00:11","","12-21","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\RH9XUR3T\1062860614545124.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The duration of the effect period is assumed to be that which maximizes the rate ratio estimate. Self- matching of cases eliminates the threat of control-selection bias and increases efficiency.

"J28JINP5","journalArticle","","Bates, Timothy C; Neale, Michael; Maes, Hermine","umx: Twin and Path-based Structural Equation Modeling in OpenMx","","","","","","Structural equation modeling (SEM) is an important research tool, especially in the social sciences. Two major uses of SEM include path-based model speciﬁcation, where ease of use and graphical and table-based reporting are important for researcher productivity, and complex multi-group and multi-level models developed in ﬁelds such as behavior genetics where the model speciﬁcation might often involve dozens or hundreds of lines of matrix-based code. Often these models are experienced as difﬁcult to implement, and may present a steep learning curve before results can be obtained. This paper describes the umx library, which is available on CRAN. It is ideal for both beginners and for those working on complex models. umx supports rapid development, modiﬁcation, and comparison of models, as well as both graphical and tabular reporting. High-level support is provided for several standard multi-group genetic models for twin data that involve additive genetic, common environment and speciﬁc environment variance components. These support raw and covariance data, including joint ordinal, and give solutions for ACE, ACE with covariates, Common Pathway, Independent Pathway, and Gene × Environment interaction models implemented as “one-line” functions. A tutorial site and question forum are also available.","","2020-04-18 04:23:03","2020-04-18 04:23:03","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\9524USMQ\Bates et al. - umx Twin and Path-based Structural Equation Model.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show for general cognitive ability that, to the contrary, genetic influence increases with age. The heritability of general cognitive ability increases significantly and linearly from 41% in childhood (9 years) to 55% in adolescence (12 years) and to 66% in young adulthood (17 years) in a sample of 11 000 pairs of twins from four countries, a larger sample than all previous studies combined. In addition to its far-reaching implications for neuroscience and molecular genetics, this finding suggests new ways of thinking about the interface between nature and nurture during the school years. Why, despite life’s ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’, do genetically driven differences increasingly account for differences in general cognitive ability? We suggest that the answer lies with genotype–environment correlation: as children grow up, they increasingly select, modify and even create their own experiences in part based on their genetic propensities.","2010-11","2020-04-18 04:16:38","2020-04-18 04:16:39","2020-04-18 04:16:38","1112-1120","","11","15","","Mol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\M65KZXWT\Haworth et al. - 2010 - The heritability of general cognitive ability incr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ben Forta's  Learning Regular Expressions  teaches you the regular expressions that you really need to know, starting with simple text matches and working up to more complex topics, including the use of backreferences, conditional evaluation, and look-ahead processing. You’ll learn what you can use, and you’ll learn it methodically, systematically, and simply.    Regular expressions are nowhere near as complex as they appear to be at first glance. All it takes is a clear understanding of the problem being solved and how to leverage regular expressions to solve them.   Read and understand regular expressions Use literal text and metacharacters to build powerful search patterns Take advantage of advanced regular expression features, including lookahead and backreferences Perform powerful search-and-replace operations in all major professional editing tools Add sophisticated form and text processing to web applications Search for files using command-line tools like grep and egrep Use regular expressions in programming languages like JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, Microsoft .NET, and C#, as well as in DBMSs including MySQL and Oracle Work with phone numbers, postal codes, social security numbers, IP addresses, URLs, email addresses, and credit card numbers   Contents at a Glance     1 Introducing Regular Expressions 2 Matching Single Characters 3 Matching Sets of Characters 4 Using Metacharacters 5 Repeating Matches 6 Position Matching 7 Using Subexpressions 8 Using Backreferences 9 Looking Ahead and Behind 10 Embedding Conditions 11 Regular Expression Solutions to Common Problems    Appendix A Regular Expressions in Popular Applications and Languages","2018-05-25","2020-04-18 08:30:08","2020-04-18 08:31:34","","","144","","","","","","","","","","Addison-Wesley Professional","Indianapolis, IN","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\Z5HIBIEU\Forta - 2018 - Learning Regular Expressions.pdf","https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Regular-Expressions-Ben-Forta/dp/0134757068","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1 edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CK2UFTQM","book","2006","","Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay On The Geography Of Anger","","978-0-8223-3863-5","","","","The period since 1989 has been marked by the global endorsement of open markets, the free flow of finance capital and liberal ideas of constitutional rule, and the active expansion of human rights. Why, then, in this era of intense globalization, has there been a proliferation of violence, of ethnic cleansing on the one hand and extreme forms of political violence against civilian populations on the other?Fear of Small Numbers is Arjun Appadurai’s answer to that question. A leading theorist of globalization, Appadurai turns his attention to the complex dynamics fueling large-scale, culturally motivated violence, from the genocides that racked Eastern Europe, Rwanda, and India in the early 1990s to the contemporary “war on terror.” Providing a conceptually innovative framework for understanding sources of global violence, he describes how the nation-state has grown ambivalent about minorities at the same time that minorities, because of global communication technologies and migration flows, increasingly see themselves as parts of powerful global majorities. By exacerbating the inequalities produced by globalization, the volatile, slippery relationship between majorities and minorities foments the desire to eradicate cultural difference.Appadurai analyzes the darker side of globalization: suicide bombings; anti-Americanism; the surplus of rage manifest in televised beheadings; the clash of global ideologies; and the difficulties that flexible, cellular organizations such as Al-Qaeda present to centralized, “vertebrate” structures such as national governments. Powerful, provocative, and timely, Fear of Small Numbers is a thoughtful invitation to rethink what violence is in an age of globalization.","2006-05-24","2020-04-18 08:22:18","2020-04-18 08:22:18","","","176","","","","","Fear of Small Numbers","","","","","Duke University Press","Durham","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6WR892FJ\2006 - Fear of Small Numbers An Essay On The Geography O.pdf; ","https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Small-Numbers-Geography-Public/dp/0822338637","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper highlights work of scholars who made significant theoretical contributions to the topic. Design and Methods: A thorough review and evaluation of the literature on successful aging was undertaken. Results: Our review includes early gerontological definitions of successful aging and related concepts. Historical perspectives reach back to philosophical and religious texts, and more recent approaches have focused on both process- and outcome-oriented models of successful aging. We elaborate on Baltes and Baltes’ theory of selective optimization with compensation [). Psychological perspectives on successful aging: The model of selective optimization with compensation. In P.

Additional views on successful aging emphasize subjective versus objective perceptions of successful aging and relate successful aging to studies on healthy and exceptional longevity.

However, the overall evidence for the effects of dietary interventions on mood and mental well-being has yet to be assessed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining effects of dietary interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety.         Methods          Major electronic databases were searched through March 2018 for all randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions reporting changes in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in clinical and nonclinical populations. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to determine effect sizes (Hedges' g with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for dietary interventions compared with control conditions. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using subgroups and meta-regression analyses.         Results          Sixteen eligible randomized controlled trials (published in English) with outcome data for 45,826 participants were included; the majority of which examined samples with nonclinical depression (n = 15 studies). Nonetheless, dietary interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms (g = 0.275, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.45, p = .002). Similar effects were observed among high-quality trials (g = 0.321, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.53, p = .002) and when compared with both inactive (g = 0.308, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.60, p = .038) and active controls (g = 0.174, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.34, p = .035). No effect of dietary interventions was observed for anxiety (k = 11, n = 2270, g = 0.100, 95% CI = −0.04 to 0.24, p = .148). Studies with female samples observed significantly greater benefits from dietary interventions, for symptoms of both depression and anxiety.         Conclusions          Dietary interventions hold promise as a novel intervention for reducing symptoms of depression across the population. Future research is required to determine the specific components of dietary interventions that improve mental health, explore underlying mechanisms, and establish effective schemes for delivering these interventions in clinical and public health settings.

The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials.

Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.</p>","2020-04-17","2020-04-21 05:56:19","2020-04-21 05:56:19","2020-04-21 05:56:19","2020.04.14.20065771","","","","","","A systematic review of antibody mediated immunity to coronaviruses","","","","","","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Methods We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","2020-04-01","2020-04-19 06:27:01","2020-04-19 06:27:01","2020-04-19 06:27:01","284-286","","","93","","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DWNGC87V\nishiura_et_al_2020_serial_interval_of_novel_coronavirus_(covid-19)_infections.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\UKZVDHDR\S1201971220301193.html","","","Epidemiology; Coronavirus; Viruses; Generation time; Illness onset; Outbreak; Statistical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. Methods We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2·5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people.

This paper examines mathematical models of both single-step and iterative contact tracing schemes and analyses the ability of these procedures to trace core groups and the sensitivity of the intervention to the timescale of tracing. An iterative tracing process is shown to be particularly eﬀective at uncovering high-risk individuals, and thus it provides a powerful public health tool. Further targeting of tracing eﬀort is considered. When the population exhibits like-with-like (assortative) mixing the required eﬀort for eradication can be signiﬁcantly reduced by preferentially tracing the contacts of high-risk individuals ; in populations where individuals have reliable information about their contacts, further gains in eﬃciency can be realized. Contact tracing is, therefore, potentially an even more potent tool than its present usage suggests.","2007-04","2020-04-19 06:20:19","2020-04-19 06:20:19","2020-04-19 06:20:19","443-454","","3","135","","Epidemiol.

From a modeling perspective, explicitly incorporating contact tracing with disease dynamics presents challenges, and population level effects of contact tracing are difﬁcult to determine. In this work, we formulate and analyze a mechanistic SEIR type outbreak model which considers the key features of contact tracing, and we characterize the impact of contact tracing on the effective reproduction number, Re, of Ebola. In particular, we determine how relevant epidemiological properties such as incubation period, infectious period and case reporting, along with varying monitoring protocols, affect the efﬁcacy of contact tracing. In the special cases of either perfect monitoring of traced cases or perfect reporting of all cases, we derive simple formulae for the critical proportion of contacts that need to be traced in order to bring the effective reproduction number Re below one. Also, in either case, we show that Re can be expressed completely in terms of observable reported case/tracing quantities, namely Re ¼ kðð1 À qÞ=qÞ þ km where k is the number of secondary traced infected contacts per primary untraced reported case, km is the number of secondary traced infected contacts per primary traced reported case and ð1 À qÞ=q is the odds that a reported case is not a traced contact. These formulae quantify contact tracing as both an intervention strategy that impacts disease spread and a probe into the current epidemic status at the population level. Data from the West Africa Ebola outbreak is utilized to form real-time estimates of Re, and inform our projections of the impact of contact tracing, and other control measures, on the epidemic trajectory.","2015-11","2020-04-19 06:18:51","2020-04-19 06:18:51","2020-04-19 06:18:51","33-49","","","384","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LSDD88JE\Browne et al. - 2015 - Modeling contact tracing in outbreaks with applica.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The risk compensation hypothesis suggests that drivers enjoying greater safety will drive more recklessly and thereby impose greater risks on nonoccupants. We provide a test of the risk compensation hypothesis in the context of state seatbelt laws and belt use rates. Methods. Fixed-effects models with policy and demographic variables are estimated using annual state data from 1985 to 2002 to test the effect of seatbelt laws and seatbelt use rates on logged fatality rates for occupants, pedestrians, motorcyclists, and all nonoccupants in separate models. Results. Contrary to the risk compensation hypothesis, the results indicate that both occupants and nonoccupants enjoy greater safety due to state mandatory use laws and increased safety belt use rates. Conclusion. Overall, seatbelt laws and the higher belt use these laws induce do not increase nonoccupant risk exposure. If anything, these laws and the accompanying increase in belt use result in safer driving behavior.","2007","2020-04-18 23:47:47","2020-04-18 23:47:47","2020-04-18 23:47:47","913-936","","4","88","","","Risk Compensation or Risk Reduction?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00510.x","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\68FQ73SL\j.1540-6237.2007.00510.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We developed four overarching issues to use as a starting point for developing an ethical framework for telehealth. We then reviewed telemedicine ethics guidelines elaborated by the American Medical Association (AMA), the World Medical Association (WMA), and the telehealth component of the Health Professions council of South Africa (HPCSA). We then compared these guidelines with practitioner perspectives to identify the similarities and differences between them. Finally, we generated suggestions to bridge the gap between ethics guidelines and the micro level use of telehealth.   Results: Clear differences emerged between the ethics guidelines and the practitioner perspectives. The main reason for the differences were the different contexts where telehealth was used, for example, variability in international practice and variations in the complexity of patient-provider interactions. Overall, published guidelines largely focus on macro level issues related to technology and maintaining data security in patient-provider interactions while practitioner concern is focused on applying the guidelines to specific micro level contexts.   Conclusions: Ethics guidelines on telehealth have a macro level focus in contrast to the micro level needs of practitioners. Work is needed to close this gap. We recommend that both telehealth practitioners and ethics guideline developers better understand healthcare systems and adopt a learning health system approach that draws upon different contexts of clinical practice, innovative models of care delivery, emergent data and evidence-based outcomes. This would help develop a clearer set of priorities and guidelines for the ethical conduct of telehealth.","2020-04-17","2020-04-23 04:59:33","2020-04-23 04:59:33","2020-04-23 04:59:33","","","","","","Yearb Med Inform","Ethics in Telehealth","","","","","","","en","Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart","","","","www.thieme-connect.com","","Publisher: Georg Thieme Verlag KG","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\5SAHGPSM\Kuziemsky et al. - 2020 - Ethics in Telehealth Comparison between Guideline.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\T55IRI3S\s-0040-1701976.html","","","Ethics; informatics; learning health system; telehealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mathematical models that represented how contact tracing and follow-up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control interventions, estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely epidemiology. We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak.

Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.","2020-03-20","2020-04-28 04:29:26","2020-04-28 04:29:26","2020-04-28 04:29:26","","","","","","","2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.preprints.org","","Publisher: Preprints","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VBJIECNR\Dietz et al_2020_2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GPWBT5PT\v2.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the second infection from infected patients particularly within general hospitals frequently takes places due to improperly hospitalized and/or quarantined patients. Accordingly, it becomes a great concern to accommodate safer ventilation system in general hospital wards against such airborne transmitted viruses. It is also a recent trend that many urban general hospitals are designed and constructed as high-rises. If a virus is transmitted through uncontrolled air movement within a hospital and then infected other patients or healthy visitors, it might be impossible to control the spread of the disease. Thus research has been preceded scrutinizing stack effect on the indoor airborne virus transmission in large hospitals by conducting both the field measurement and numerical analysis according to the outdoor temperature and the releasing vertical points of the tracer gas assumed as a viral contaminant. In the field measurement of a high-rise hospital, the indoor airflow was affected by the stack effect of vertical chute of the building. The numerical simulation was verified by comparing its prediction results and the field measurement data. In result, very high possibility has witnessed that the airborne contaminant emitted from the infected patients in the lower floors could be transported to the higher floors through the airflow driven by the stack effect.","2011-12-01","2020-04-28 04:46:56","2020-04-28 04:46:56","2020-04-28 04:46:56","2413-2424","","12","46","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PWZ3S2LI\Lim et al_2011_Predictions and measurements of the stack effect on indoor airborne virus.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\23TTSKGX\S036013231100117X.html","","","Airborne virus transmission; High-rise hospital; Network airflow model; Stack effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic time lag between infection and death. In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al 2020, Report #13, Imperial College London] to include (a) population saturation effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more balanced prior on intervention effects and (d) partial pooling of the lockdown intervention covariate. We also (e) included another 3 countries (Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal). The model code is available at https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model/ We are now reporting the results of our updated model online at https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19estimates/ We estimated parameters jointly for all M=14 countries in a single hierarchical model. Inference is performed in the probabilistic programming language Stan using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.","2020-04-23","2020-04-30 23:48:33","2020-04-30 23:48:33","2020-04-30 23:48:33","","","","","","","Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in European countries","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2004.11342","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GAFUQHMJ\2004.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\HCJ62L9T\Flaxman et al_2020_Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical.pdf","","","Statistics - Applications; Statistics - Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is suggested that while discussing about “climate change”, different policy arenas perceive different problems implying different responsibility attributions and different solutions. Design/methodology/approach The study mobilizes different sources, such as regulations, research reports, and scientific papers, combined with personal interviews with international agents participating in the climate policy negotiations process. Findings Initially, climate change has been defined as an environmental degradation problem. Progressively, other competing definitions of the problem occupied the public debate. Alternatively, climate change has been discussed as a development issue, a migration issue and a security issue. The paper argues that while this polyphonic discourse persists, the problem definition process remains unaccomplished, new institutional equilibriums cannot be established and, consequently, policymaking cannot follow. Practical implications By focusing on the different perceptions and debates of the climate issue, this paper points to the conflicts transcending the international arena. This gives policy actors a wider view of the negotiating process in which they are involved. Originality/value Most analyses explain the success or failure of international agreements by pointing to either the presence/lack of governmental compliance or the institutional complexity and need for coordination between enforcement agencies. Less attention is paid to the way public problems are perceived by different policy communities. This paper focuses on the definitional debates accompanying the post-Kyoto negotiations and their impact on the policy making process.","2012-01-01","2020-05-06 02:42:12","2020-05-06 02:42:12","2020-05-06 02:42:12","104-118","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\BCZ2H6JH\Anne Vlassopoulos_2012_Competing definition of climate change and the post-Kyoto negotiations.pdf","","","Decision making; Climate change; Adaptation; Climate change strategies; Conferences; International cooperation; International negotiations; Mitigation; Problem definition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. Methods We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial/ )., In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual‐level scores of genetic risk. Results The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands‐on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users. Conclusions By providing theoretical background and hands‐on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.","2018-02-27","2020-05-07 06:40:43","2020-05-07 06:40:43","2020-05-07 06:40:43","","","2","27","","Int J Methods Psychiatr Res","A tutorial on conducting genome‐wide association studies","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 29484742 PMCID: PMC6001694","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6EAQ5EAC\Marees et al_2018_A tutorial on conducting genome‐wide association studies.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001694/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required.                                         Results               Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power.                                         Conclusion               PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set–based analyses.

Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.","2020-03-31","2020-05-03 08:48:02","2020-05-03 08:48:03","2020-05-03 08:48:02","","","","","","","","","","","","Cell Biology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.28.013672","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3A9Q8LF9\Smith et al. - 2020 - Cigarette smoke exposure and inflammatory signalin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In order to address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, a webserver to enable simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Given a new sequence, CoV-Seq automatically predicts gene boundaries and identifies genetic variants, which are presented in an interactive genome visualizer and are downloadable for further analysis. A command-line interface is also available for high-throughput processing. CoV-Seq is implemented in Python and Javascript. The webserver is available at http://covseq.baidu.com/ and the source code is available from https://github.com/boxiangliu/covseq.</p>","2020-05-02","2020-05-03 08:15:36","2020-05-03 08:15:36","2020-05-03 08:15:36","2020.05.01.071050","","","","","","CoV-Seq","","","","","","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 from time series data from the USA to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.","2020-04-14","2020-05-03 08:14:10","2020-05-03 08:14:10","2020-05-03 08:14:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Originally, these icons consisted of ASCII art, and later, Shift_JIS art and Unicode art.  In recent times, graphical icons, both static and animated, have joined the traditional text-based emoticons; these are commonly known as emoji.Emoticons can generally be divided into three groups: Western (mainly from America and Europe) or horizontal (though not all are in that orientation); Eastern or vertical (mainly from east Asia); and 2channel style (originally used on 2channel and other Japanese message boards).

Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2–14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3–4 days without truncation and at 5–9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days.

Understanding a study’s data generating structure and translating that data structure into a DAG can be challenging, but these skills are often glossed over in training. Campbell and Stanley’s framework for causal inference has been extraordinarily influential in social science training programs but has received less attention in epidemiology. Their work, along with subsequent revisions and enhancements based on practical experience conducting empirical studies, presents a catalog of 37 threats to validity describing reasons empirical studies may fail to deliver causal effects. We interpret most of these threats to study validity as suggestions for common causal structures. Threats are organized into issues of statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, or external validity. To assist epidemiologists in drawing the correct DAG for their application, we map the correspondence between threats to validity and epidemiologic concepts that can be represented with DAGs. Representing these threats as DAGs makes them amenable to formal analysis with d-separation rules and breaks down cross-disciplinary language barriers in communicating methodologic issues.","2020-05","2020-05-08 23:45:41","2020-05-08 23:45:41","2020-05-08 23:45:41","376–384","","3","31","","","A Graphical Catalog of Threats to Validity","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\XCRRQ4LJ\Matthay_Glymour_2020_A Graphical Catalog of Threats to Validity.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\HRMWYV4N\A_Graphical_Catalog_of_Threats_to_Validity_.11.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, I use a causal framework and the Price equation to develop the gene's eye perspective. Genes are causally special in being both replicators and interactors. Gene effects are tied together in a complex Gouldian knot of interactions, but Fisher deployed three swords to try to cut the knot. The first, Fisher's average excess, is non-causal, so not fully satisfactory in that respect. The Price equation highlights Fisher's other two swords, choosing to model only selection, and only the part that is transmissible across generations. The models developed here show that many causes of organismal fitness do not cause Gouldian complications. Only two kinds of elements must be added to the focal gene for a causal explanation of its selective change: co-replicators that are associated with the focal gene and co-interactors that interact non-additively with the focal gene. Identical equations for co-replication and co-interaction describe interactions between gene copies at a single locus or at separate loci, and also for genes situated within the same individual or in different individuals. These results resolve some of the objections to the gene's eye view.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Fifty years of the Price equation’.","2020-04-27","2020-05-10 21:12:18","2020-05-10 21:12:18","2020-05-10 21:12:18","20190354","","1797","375","","Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PSPFI2MH\Queller_2020_The gene's eye view, the Gouldian knot, Fisherian swords and the causes of.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\EZK9J6YR\rstb.2019.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we bring the issue of causal interpretation to the fore, by studying the conditions under which it is legitimate to read causal meaning into the Price equation. We argue that only if substantive assumptions about causal structure are made, which can be represented in the form of a causal model, can the component terms of the Price equation be interpreted as causally meaningful.

We introduce a new graph, the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independences associated with a speciﬁc hypothetical intervention on the set of treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the corresponding counterfactual random variables. We illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Our graphical theory of SWIGs may be used to infer the counterfactual independence relations that hold among the SWIG variables under the FFRCISTG model of Robins (1986) and the NPSEM model with Independent Errors of Pearl (2000, 2009).

For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.","1986-01-01","2020-05-10 08:49:22","2020-05-10 08:49:22","2020-05-10 08:49:22","1393-1512","","9","7","","Mathematical Modelling","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\MA2RT6RE\robins_1986_a_new_approach_to_causal_inference_in_mortality_studies_with_a_sustained.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\F3B3FIHN\0270025586900886.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many metagenomic data sets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic data set can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such data sets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-metagenomic approach, examining close matches to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all high-throughput sequencing data sets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the “virome” keyword. In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (F. Wu, S. Zhao, B. Yu, Y. M. Chen, et al., Nature 579:265–269, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3; P. Zhou, X. L. Yang, X. G. Wang, B. Hu, et al., Nature 579:270 –273, 2020, https://doi.org/ 10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7), we note a strong homology to numerous sequence reads in metavirome data sets generated from the lungs of deceased pangolins reported by Liu et al. (P. Liu, W. Chen, and J. P. Chen, Viruses 11:979, 2019, https://doi.org/10.3390/ v11110979). While analysis of these reads indicates the presence of a similar viral sequence in pangolin lung, the similarity is not sufﬁcient to either conﬁrm or rule out a role for pangolins as an intermediate host in the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the implications for SARS-CoV-2 emergence, this study illustrates the utility and limitations of meta-metagenomic search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially signiﬁcant nucleic acid sequences.","2020-05-06","2020-05-09 05:07:14","2020-05-09 05:07:14","2020-05-09 05:07:14","e00160-20, /msphere/5/3/mSphere160-20.atom","","3","5","","mSphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\TWMEADLE\Wahba et al. - 2020 - An Extensive Meta-Metagenomic Search Identifies SA.pdf","","","","Imperiale, Michael J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim was to develop PRSs, optimized for prediction of estrogen receptor (ER)-specific disease, from the largest available genome-wide association dataset and to empirically validate the PRSs in prospective studies. The development dataset comprised 94,075 case subjects and 75,017 control subjects of European ancestry from 69 studies, divided into training and validation sets. Samples were genotyped using genome-wide arrays, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by stepwise regression or lasso penalized regression. The best performing PRSs were validated in an independent test set comprising 11,428 case subjects and 18,323 control subjects from 10 prospective studies and 190,040 women from UK Biobank (3,215 incident breast cancers). For the best PRSs (313 SNPs), the odds ratio for overall disease per 1 standard deviation in ten prospective studies was 1.61 (95%CI: 1.57–1.65) with area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) = 0.630 (95%CI: 0.628–0.651). The lifetime risk of overall breast cancer in the top centile of the PRSs was 32.6%. Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of risk had 4.37- and 2.78-fold risks, and those in the lowest 1% of risk had 0.16- and 0.27-fold risks, of developing ER-positive and ER-negative disease, respectively. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that this PRS was well calibrated and predicts disease risk accurately in the tails of the distribution. This PRS is a powerful and reliable predictor of breast cancer risk that may improve breast cancer prevention programs.","2019-01-03","2020-05-08 07:28:52","2020-05-08 07:28:52","2020-05-08 07:28:52","21-34","","1","104","","The American Journal of Human Genetics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\4UC9HJ2L\mavaddat_et_al_2019_polygenic_risk_scores_for_prediction_of_breast_cancer_and_breast_cancer_subtypes.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\MX9JPS57\S0002929718304051.html","","","cancer; epidemiology; prediction; breast; genetic; polygenic; risk; score; screening; stratification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Common among them is a focus on quantitative approaches for solving intricate problems. When the substantive area is health and health care, the overlap is further cemented. Researchers in these disciplines are fluent in statistics, data management and analysis, and health and medicine, to name but a few competencies. Yet there are important and perhaps mutually exclusive attributes of these fields that warrant a tighter integration. For example, epidemiologists receive substantial training in the science of study design, measurement, and the art of causal inference. Biostatisticians are well versed in the theory and application of methodological techniques, as well as the design and conduct of public health research. Data scientists receive equivalently rigorous training in computational and visualization approaches for high-dimensional data. Compared to data scientists, epidemiologists and biostatisticians may have less expertise in computer science and informatics, while data scientists may benefit from a working knowledge of study design and causal inference. Collaboration and cross-training offer the opportunity to share and learn of the constructs, frameworks, theories, and methods of these fields with the goal of offering fresh and innovate perspectives for tackling challenging problems in health and health care. In this article, we first describe the evolution of these fields focusing on their convergence in the era of electronic health data, notably electronic medical records (EMRs). Next we present how a collaborative team may design, analyze, and implement an EMR-based study. Finally, we review the curricula at leading epidemiology, biostatistics, and data science training programs, identifying gaps and offering suggestions for the fields moving forward.","","2020-05-15 01:11:00","2020-05-15 01:11:00","2020-05-15 01:11:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\CWPQGDLJ\Goldstein et al_On the Convergence of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Data Science.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\NFP4RD8V\1.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We are concerned that studies of sacrificial dilemmas may lack experimental, mundane, and psychological realism and therefore suffer from low external validity. Our apprehensions stem from three observations about trolley problems and other similar sacrificial dilemmas: (i) they are amusing rather than sobering, (ii) they are unrealistic and unrepresentative of the moral situations people encounter in the real world, and (iii) they do not elicit the same psychological processes as other moral situations. We believe it would be prudent to use more externally valid stimuli when testing descriptive theories that aim to provide comprehensive accounts of moral judgment and behavior.","2014","2020-05-18 21:29:42","2020-05-18 21:29:42","2020-05-18 21:29:42","536-554","","9","8","","","Revisiting External Validity","","","","","","","en","© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/spc3.12131","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\XPB8KBGB\Bauman et al_2014_Revisiting External Validity.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\JMIT6Q6P\spc3.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since GitHub offers unique features that are different from traditional ways of collaborative writing, it is interesting to investigate how GitHub features are used for writing. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings of a mixed-methods, case study of collaboration practices in a GitHub book project. We found that the use of GitHub depended on task interdependence and audience participation. GitHub’s direct push method was used to coordinate both loosely- and tightly-coupled work, with the latter requiring collaborators to follow socially-accepted conventions. The pull-based method was adopted once the project was released to the public. While face-toface and online meetings were prominent in the early phases, GitHub's issues became instrumental for communication and project management in later phases. Our findings have implications for the design of collaborative writing tools.","2018-10-30","2020-06-05 01:11:52","2020-06-05 01:11:52","2020-06-05 01:11:52","305-308","","","","","","Collaborative Writing on GitHub","","","","","ACM","Jersey City NJ USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\RJUYICDW\Pe-Than et al. - 2018 - Collaborative Writing on GitHub A Case Study of a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CSCW '18: Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional research and multi-author writing processes break down at scale. We present new software named Manubot, available at https://manubot.org, to address the challenges of open scholarly writing. Manubot adopts the contribution workflow used by many large-scale open source software projects to enable collaborative authoring of scholarly manuscripts. With Manubot, manuscripts are written in Markdown and stored in a Git repository to precisely track changes over time. By hosting manuscript repositories publicly, such as on GitHub, multiple authors can simultaneously propose and review changes. A cloud service automatically evaluates proposed changes to catch errors. Publication with Manubot is continuous: When a manuscript’s source changes, the rendered outputs are rebuilt and republished to a web page. Manubot automates bibliographic tasks by implementing citation by identifier, where users cite persistent identifiers (e.g. DOIs, PubMed IDs, ISBNs, URLs), whose metadata is then retrieved and converted to a user-specified style. Manubot modernizes publishing to align with the ideals of open science by making it transparent, reproducible, immediate, versioned, collaborative, and free of charge.","2019-06-24","2020-06-05 01:14:57","2020-06-05 01:14:57","2020-06-05 01:14:57","e1007128","","6","15","","PLOS Computational Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DDCVCAHR\Himmelstein et al_2019_Open collaborative writing with Manubot.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\2PM74A5J\article.html","","","Open source software; Citation analysis; Internet; Metadata; Open science; Peer review; Scientific publishing; Web-based applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Y9ITKI8K","webpage","","","The Zettelkasten Method - LessWrong 2.0","","","","","https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1","Early this year, Conor White-Sullivan introduced me to the Zettelkasten method of note-taking. I would say that this significantly increased my research productivity. I’ve been saying “at least 2x”. Naturally, this sort of thing is difficult to quantify. The truth is, I think it may be more like 3x, especially along the dimension of “producing ideas” and also “early-stage development of ideas”. (What I mean by this will become clearer as I describe how I think about research productivity more generally.) However, it is also very possible that the method produces serious biases in the types of ideas produced/developed, which should be considered. (This would be difficult to quantify at the best of times, but also, it should be noted that other factors have dramatically  decreased my overall research productivity. So, unfortunately, someone looking in from outside would not see an overall boost. Still, my impression is that it's been very useful.) I think there are some specific reasons why Zettelkasten has worked so well for me. I’ll try to make those clear, to help readers decide whether it would work for them. However, I honestly didn’t think Zettelkasten sounded like a good idea before I tried it. It only took me about 30 minutes of working with the cards to decide that it was really good. So, if you’re like me, this is a cheap experiment. I think a lot of people should actually try it to see how they like it, even if it sounds terrible. My plan for this document is to first give a short summary and then an overview of Zettelkasten, so that readers know roughly what I’m talking about, and can possibly experiment with it without reading any further. I’ll then launch into a longer discussion of why it worked well for me, explaining the specific habits which I think contributed, including some descriptions of my previous approaches to keeping research notes. I expect some of this may be useful even if you don’t use Zettelkasten -- if Zettelkasten isn’t for you, may","","2020-06-07 21:40:15","2020-06-07 21:40:15","2020-06-07 21:40:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\2D9KSFFA\The Zettelkasten Method - LessWrong 2.0.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nurses with a range of experience and reported skill-fulness were interviewed. Each study used nurses’ narrative accounts of actual clinical situations. A subsample of participants were observed and interviewed at work. These studies extend the understanding of the Dreyfus model to complex, underdetermined, and fast-paced practices. The skill of involvement and the development of moral agency are linked with the development of expertise, and change as the practitioner becomes more skillful. Nurses who had some difficulty with understanding the ends of practice and difficulty with their skills of interpersonal and problem engagement did not progress to the level of expertise. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the usefulness of the Dreyfus model for understanding the learning needs and styles of learning at different levels of skill acquisition.","2004-06-01","2020-05-22 10:03:30","2020-05-22 10:03:30","2020-05-22 10:03:30","188-199","","3","24","","Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\K4YDRZMZ\benner_2004_using_the_dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition_to_describe_and_interpret_skill.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72℃ and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70℃ and 12.42℃ respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1℃ increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1℃ increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86.  Conclusion  The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.","2020-02-25","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.02.22.20025791","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\FGVNTPNU\wang_et_al_2020_temperature_significant_change_covid-19_transmission_in_429_cities.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 °C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases.","2020-03-20","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2427","","6","12","","Sustainability","Investigating a Serious Challenge in the Sustainable Development Process","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ZDK28IVF\pirouz_et_al_2020_investigating_a_serious_challenge_in_the_sustainable_development_process.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS The number of new confirm COVID-19 cases in mainland China peaked on Feb 1, 2020. COVID-19 daily incidence were lowest at -10 ℃ and highest at 10 ℃,while the maximum incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g/m3. COVID-19 incidence changed with temperature as daily incidence decreased when the temperature rose. No significant association between COVID-19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models. Additionally, A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale. CONCLUSION Temperature is an environmental driver of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Lower and higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence.

Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.","2020-04-14","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.10.20059337","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\X43CKR6F\pirouz_et_al_2020_relationship_between_average_daily_temperature_and_average_cumulative_daily.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discounting the effect of the timeline variable, we obtain an estimate for the initial growth rate of Covid-19, which can be also used to estimate the basic reproduction number for a region, in terms of population density. This has policy implications regarding how to control the pace of Covid-10 outbreak in a particular area, and we discuss some of them. In the case of countries, for which we did not have demographic information, weather variables lose statistical significance once the timeline variable is added. Relaxing CI requirements, absolute humidity contributes mildly to the reduction of growth rate of cases for the countries studied. Our results suggest that population density should be employed as a control variable and that analysis should have a local character, for subregions and countries separately, in studies involving the dynamics of Covid-19 and similar infectious diseases.","2020-04-27","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","The dynamics of Covid-19","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.21.20074450","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ZBBC4BJP\pedrosa_2020_the_dynamics_of_covid-19.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","2020-03-08","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Public and Global Health","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.05.20031872","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\AIEDES2I\oliveiros_et_al_2020_role_of_temperature_and_humidity_in_the_modulation_of_the_doubling_time_of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyze the rate α in different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate α and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a {\it base} set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic at an earlier stage, an {\it intermediate} set of 88 countries and an {\it extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a linear behavior α(T), we find increasing evidence in the three datasets for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T, at $99.66\%$C.L., $99.86\%$C.L. and $99.99995 \%$ C.L. ($p$-value $5 \cdot 10^{-7}$, or 5$\sigma$ detection) in the {\it base}, {\it intermediate}  and {\it extended} dataset, respectively.  The doubling time is expected to increase by $40\%\sim 50\%$, going from $5^\circ$ C to $25^\circ$ C. In the {\it base} set, going beyond a linear model, a  peak at about $(7.7\pm 3.6)^\circ C$ seems to be present in the data, but such evidence disappears for the larger datasets.  Moreover we have analyzed the possible existence of a bias: poor countries, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding countries below a given GDP per capita from the dataset, we find that this affects our conclusions only slightly and only for the {\it extended} dataset. The significance always remains high, with a $p$-value of about $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.","2020-03-30","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.26.20044529","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6QJL5KNN\notari_2020_temperature_dependence_of_covid-19_transmission.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Taking Hubei province of China as an example, where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of confirmed cases (total 67773 cases) and ten meteorological parameters up to March 10. Correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Results: Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=+0.358).The negative correlations included average temperature (r=-0.306), minimum temperature (r=-0.347), and average water vapor pressure (r=-0.326). The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1℃, the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. Conclusion: Statistically, the incidence of COVID-19 was correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure.

Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","2020-02-17","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\IABPI57J\neher_et_al_2020_potential_impact_of_seasonal_forcing_on_a_sars-cov-2_pandemic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early insights from laboratory studies of related coronaviruses predicted that COVID-19 would decline at higher temperatures, humidity, and ultraviolet light. Using current, fine-scaled weather data and global reports of infection we developed a model that explained 36% of variation in early growth rates before intervention, with 17% based on weather or demography and 19% based on country-specific effects. We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower COVID-19 growth rates.  Projections suggest that, in the absence of intervention, COVID-19 will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter. However, uncertainty remains high and the probability of a weekly doubling rate remained >20% throughout the summer in the absence of control.

Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. Conclusion: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Several studies predicted that high temperature and humidity could reduce COVID-19 transmission. However, exceptions exist to this observation, further thorough examinations are thus needed for their confirmation. In this study, therefore, we used a global dataset of COVID-19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID-19 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial analysis. We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; however, the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity rather than temperature. In particular, a lower growth rate was observed for a higher precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity. These effects were independent of population density, human life quality, and travel restrictions. The results indicate that the temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics, which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions. However, the contributions of the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather, the contribution of travel restrictions in each country was more significant. Although our findings are preliminary owing to data-analysis limitations, they may be helpful when predicting COVID-19 transmission.","2020-04-14","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.10.20060459","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PKWDKYZT\chiyomaru_takemoto_2020_global_covid-19_transmission_rate_is_influenced_by_precipitation_seasonality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r             2             >0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.","2020-03-20","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\SY2DAS88\chen_et_al_2020_roles_of_meteorological_conditions_in_covid-19_transmission_on_a_worldwide_scale.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD Pearson correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available. RESULTS The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P<0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION The associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time.

Relationships between Covid-19 and climate were robust to the potential confounding effects of air pollution and socio-economic variables, including population size, density and health expenditure.

In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA). Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve. Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12± 0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24± 0.01), (P<0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12± 0.02 vs. 0.25±  0.01 than in cold climate countries (P<0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS as of March, 19, 2020.  Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in various countries as well as in regions within these countries. As such, some associations may be more affected by local transmission patterns rather than by climate.

Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID-19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS-CoV-1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub- Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.","2020-03-16","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\I5YYCG3X\araujo_naimi_2020_spread_of_sars-cov-2_coronavirus_likely_to_be_constrained_by_climate.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1°C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.","2020-03-30","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.26.20044420","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PZBN42AE\carleton_meng_2020_causal_empirical_estimates_suggest_covid-19_transmission_rates_are_highly.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To analyze the role of temperature, humidity, date of first case diagnosed (DFC) and the behavior of the growth-curve of cumulative frequency (CF) [number of days to rise (DCS) and reach the first 100 cases (D100), and the difference between them (ΔDD)] with the doubling time (Td) of Covid-19 cases in 67 countries grouped by climate zone. Design. Retrospective incident case study. Setting. WHO based register of cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases. Participants. 1,706,914 subjects diagnosed between 12-29-2019 and 4-15-2020. Exposures. SARS-Cov-2 virus, ambient humidity, temperature and climate areas (temperate, tropical/subtropical). Main outcome measures. Comparison of DCS, D100, ΔDD, DFC, humidity, temperature, Td for the first (Td10) and second (Td20) ten days of the CF growth-curve between countries according to climate zone, and identification of factors involved in Td, as well as predictors of  CF using lineal regression models. Results. Td10 and Td20 were ≥3 days longer in tropical/subtropical vs. temperate areas (2.8[plusmn]1.2 vs. 5.7[plusmn]3.4; p=1.41E-05 and 4.6[plusmn]1.8 vs. 8.6[plusmn]4.2; p=9.7E-05, respectively). The factors involved in Td10 (DFC and ΔDD) were different than those in Td20 (Td10 and climate areas). After D100, the fastest growth-curves during the first 10 days, were associated with Td10<2 and Td10<3 in temperate and tropical/subtropical countries, respectively. The fold change Td20/Td10 >2 was associated with earlier flattening of the growth-curve. In multivariate models, Td10, DFC and ambient temperature were negatively related with CF and explained 44.7% (r2 = 0.447) of CF variability at day 20 of  the growth-curve, while Td20 and DFC were negatively related with CF and explained 63.8% (r2 = 0.638) of CF variability towards day 30 of the growth-curve. Conclusions. The larger Td in tropical/subtropical countries is positively related to DFC and temperature. Td and environmental factors explain 64% of CF variability in the best of cases. Therefore, other factors, such as pandemic containment measures, would explain the remaining variability.","2020-04-23","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","Trends of SARS-Cov-2 infection in 67 countries","","","","","Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.18.20070920","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LDNC8H6E\berumen_et_al_2020_trends_of_sars-cov-2_infection_in_67_countries.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By January 2020, the potential risks imposed by 2019-nCoV in human health and economical activity were promptly highlighted. Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to mitigate the number of infected and deaths. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission. Correlations between meteorological temperature and relative humidity with the number of daily confirmed cases were explored in this work for the epicenter city of Wuhan, China for the period from 29 January to March 6, 2020. Long-term trend of temperature and relative humidity was obtained with a 14-days adjacent-averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019-nCoV cases, where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets.","2020-03-23","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","2020-05-21 23:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.19.20039164","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\W3HW96BC\alvarez-ramirez_meraz_2020_role_of_meteorological_temperature_and_relative_humidity_in_the.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Formal rules governing signed edges on causal directed acyclic graphs are described and it is shown how these rules can be useful in reasoning about causality. Specifically, the notions of a monotonic effect, a weak monotonic effect and a signed edge are introduced. Results are developed relating these monotonic effects and signed edges to the sign of the causal effect of an intervention in the presence of intermediate variables. The incorporation of signed edges in the directed acyclic graph causal framework furthermore allows for the development of rules governing the relationship between monotonic effects and the sign of the covariance between two variables. It is shown that when certain assumptions about monotonic effects can be made then these results can be used to draw conclusions about the presence of causal effects even when data are missing on confounding variables.","2010","2020-05-17 03:36:26","2020-05-17 03:36:26","2020-05-17 03:36:26","111-127","","1","72","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 Royal Statistical Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00728.x","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DUE8DFQS\j.1467-9868.2009.00728.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\49YFRTAA\vanderweele_robins_2010_signed_directed_acyclic_graphs_for_causal_inference.pdf","","","Bias; Causal inference; Confounding; Directed acyclic graphs; Structural equations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methylation may have an important role in arsenic toxicity, because the monomethylated trivalent metabolite [MMA(III)] is highly toxic. Objectives: We assessed the relationship of creatinine and nutrition—using dietary intake and blood concentrations of micronutrients—with arsenic metabolism, as reflected in the proportions of InAS, MMA, and DMA in urine, in the first study that incorporated both dietary and micro­ nutrient data. Methods: We studied methylation patterns and nutritional factors in 405 persons who were selected from a cross-sectional survey of 7,638 people in an arsenic-exposed population in West Bengal, India. We assessed associations of urine creatinine and nutritional factors (19 dietary intake variables and 16 blood micronutrients) with arsenic metabolites in urine. Results: Urinary creatinine had the strongest relationship with overall arsenic methylation to DMA. Those with the highest urinary creatinine concentrations had 7.2% more arsenic as DMA compared with those with low creatinine (p < 0.001). Animal fat intake had the strongest relation­ ship with MMA% (highest tertile animal fat intake had 2.3% more arsenic as MMA, p < 0.001). Low serum selenium and low folate were also associated with increased MMA%. Conclusions: Urine creatinine concentration was the strongest biological marker of arsenic methylation efficiency, and therefore should not be used to adjust for urine concentration in arsenic studies. The new finding that animal fat intake has a positive relationship with MMA% warrants further assessment in other studies. Increased MMA% was also associated, to a lesser extent, with low serum selenium and folate.","2011-09","2020-05-16 21:36:15","2020-05-16 21:36:15","2020-05-16 21:36:15","1308-1313","","9","119","","Environmental Health Perspectives","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DXCF8PRX\Basu et al. - 2011 - Creatinine, Diet, Micronutrients, and Arsenic Meth.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A probabilistic risk assessment framework is integrated with the potency equivalence factors (PEFs), age group-specific occupancy probability and the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) approaches to quantitatively estimate the exposure risk for three age groups of adults, children, and infants. The benzo[a]pyrene equivalents based PAH concentrations in rural, traffic, and industrial areas associated with age group-specific occupancy probability at different environmental settings are used to calculate daily exposure level through inhalation and dermal contact pathways. Risk analysis indicates that the inhalation-ILCR and dermal contact-ILCR values for adults follow a lognormal distribution with geometric mean 1.04 Â 10À 4 and 3.85 Â 10À 5 and geometric standard deviation 2.10 and 2.75, respectively, indicating high potential cancer risk; whereas for the infants the risk values are less than 10À6, indicating no significant cancer risk. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the input variables of cancer slope factor and daily inhalation exposure level have the greater impact than that of body weight on the inhalation-ILCR; whereas for the dermalILCR, particle-bound PAH-to-skin adherence factor and daily dermal exposure level have the significant influence than that of body weight.","2006-07","2020-05-16 21:35:11","2020-05-16 21:35:12","2020-05-16 21:35:11","112-123","","1","366","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\7Q7IQE5F\Chen and Liao - 2006 - Health risk assessment on human exposed to environ.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease. Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.","2020","2020-06-10 05:17:13","2020-06-10 05:17:13","2020-06-10 05:17:13","1753-1766","","10","16","","Int.

The disease has spread in almost every part of the world and has been declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO). The corona virus outbreak has emerged as one of the deadliest pandemics of all time in human history. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has forced several countries of the world to observe complete lockdown forcing people to live in their homes. India also faced the phase of total lockdown for 21 days (in first phase) to avoid the spread of coronavirus to the maximum possible extent. This lockdown impacted the pollution levels of environment and improved air and water quality in the short span owing to very less human activities. The present work scientifically analyzed the available data for primary air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO) from two major Indian cities, Lucknow and New Delhi. The analysis was based on air quality data for before lockdown and after lockdown (first phase of 21 days) periods of 21 days each. The results showed significant decline in the studied air pollution indices and demonstrated improvement of air quality in both the cities. The major impact was seen in the levels of PM2.5, NO2 and CO. The levels of SO2 showed less significant decline during the lockdown period. The results are presented with future perspectives to mitigate air pollution in near future by adopting the short and periodical lockdown as a tool.","2020-06-03","2020-06-11 23:51:00","2020-06-11 23:51:00","","","","","","","Bull Environ Contam Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32495123 PMCID: PMC7266738","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3X3TIR2A\Srivastava et al_2020_21-Day Lockdown in India Dramatically Reduced Air Pollution Indices in Lucknow.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495123","","Air quality; COVID-19; Air pollution; Lockdown; PM2.5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short-term outcomes of two health science academies established by a district health board in South Auckland, New Zealand, to create a health workforce pipeline for local M aori and Pasiﬁka students. Methods. A mixed-methods approach was used, involving background discussions with key informants to generate an initial logic model of how the academies work, followed by secondary analysis of students’ records relating to retention and academic achievement, a survey of senior academy students’ interest in particular health careers and face-to-face interviews and focus groups with students, families and teachers. Results. Academy students are collectively achieving better academic results than their contemporaries, although selection decisions are likely to contribute to these results. Academies are retaining students, with over 70% of students transitioning from Year 11 to Years 12 and 13. Senior students are expressing long-term ambitions to work in the health sector. Conclusions. Health science academies show promise as an innovative approach to supporting M aori and Pasiﬁka students prepare for a career in the health professions. Evaluating the long-term outcomes of the academies is required to determine their contribution to addressing inequities in the local health workforce.","2019","2020-06-29 08:29:42","2020-06-29 10:12:08","2020-06-29 08:29:42","352","","3","43","","Aust.

Case-control studies are attractive. They can be executed quickly and at low cost, even when the disorders of interest are rare. The execution of pilot case-control studies is becoming automated; strategies have been devised for the “computer scanning” of large files of hospital admission diagnoses and prior drug exposures, with detailed analyses carried out in the same data set on an ad hoc basis. As evidence of their growing popularity, when one original article was randomly selected from each issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, and the Journal of the American Medical Association for the years 1956, 1966, and 1976, the proportion that reported case-control analytic studies increased fourfold over these two decades; however, the proportion reporting cohort analytic studies fell by half; a general trend toward fewer study subjects but more study authors was also noted.","1979-01-01","2020-07-07 01:03:30","2020-07-07 01:03:30","2020-07-07 01:03:30","51-63","","","","","","","","","","","Pergamon","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-08-024907-0.50013-4","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\U3HGKKNL\Sackett_1979_BIAS IN ANALYTIC RESEARCH.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\KQSAWS7V\B9780080249070500134.html","","","","Ibrahim, MICHEL A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale seroprevalence studies provide better estimates of the proportion of the population previously infected.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To estimate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in convenience samples from several geographic sites in the US.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This cross-sectional study performed serologic testing on a convenience sample of residual sera obtained from persons of all ages. The serum was collected from March 23 through May 12, 2020, for routine clinical testing by 2 commercial laboratory companies. Sites of collection were San Francisco Bay area, California; Connecticut; south Florida; Louisiana; Minneapolis-St Paul-St Cloud metro area, Minnesota; Missouri; New York City metro area, New York; Philadelphia metro area, Pennsylvania; Utah; and western Washington State.</p><h3>Exposures</h3><p>Infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and estimates were standardized to the site populations by age and sex. Estimates were adjusted for test performance characteristics (96.0% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity). The number of infections in each site was estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to site populations; estimated infections were compared with the number of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases as of last specimen collection date.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Serum samples were tested from 16 025 persons, 8853 (55.2%) of whom were women; 1205 (7.5%) were 18 years or younger and 5845 (36.2%) were 65 years or older. Most specimens from each site had no evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Adjusted estimates of the proportion of persons seroreactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies ranged from 1.0% in the San Francisco Bay area (collected April 23-27) to 6.9% of persons in New York City (collected March 23-April 1). The estimated number of infections ranged from 6 to 24 times the number of reported cases; for 7 sites (Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New York City metro area, Utah, and western Washington State), an estimated greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred than the number of reported cases.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>During March to early May 2020, most persons in 10 diverse geographic sites in the US had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The estimated number of infections, however, was much greater than the number of reported cases in all sites. The findings may reflect the number of persons who had mild or no illness or who did not seek medical care or undergo testing but who still may have contributed to ongoing virus transmission in the population.</p>","2020-07-21","2020-07-23 20:36:33","2020-07-23 20:36:33","2020-07-23 20:36:33","","","","","","JAMA Intern Med","","","","","","","","en","","","","","jamanetwork.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\T2BGBI3R\Havers et al_2020_Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in 10 Sites in the United States,.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PYH4P6XQ\2768834.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"884YAPPX","book","2011","Chenoweth, Erica; Stephan, Maria J.","Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict","","978-0-231-52748-4","","","","For more than a century, from 1900 to 2006, campaigns of nonviolent resistance were more than twice as effective as their violent counterparts in achieving their stated goals. By attracting impressive support from citizens, whose activism takes the form of protests, boycotts, civil disobedience, and other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, these efforts help separate regimes from their main sources of power and produce remarkable results, even in Iran, Burma, the Philippines, and the Palestinian Territories.Combining statistical analysis with case studies of specific countries and territories, Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan detail the factors enabling such campaigns to succeed and, sometimes, causing them to fail. They find that nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement and commitment, and that higher levels of participation contribute to enhanced resilience, greater opportunities for tactical innovation and civic disruption (and therefore less incentive for a regime to maintain its status quo), and shifts in loyalty among opponents' erstwhile supporters, including members of the military establishment. Chenoweth and Stephan conclude that successful nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and internally peaceful democracies, which are less likely to regress into civil war. Presenting a rich, evidentiary argument, they originally and systematically compare violent and nonviolent outcomes in different historical periods and geographical contexts, debunking the myth that violence occurs because of structural and environmental factors and that it is necessary to achieve certain political goals. Instead, the authors discover, violent insurgency is rarely justifiable on strategic grounds.","2011-08","2020-06-20 00:24:46","2020-06-20 00:25:58","","","","","","","","Why Civil Resistance Works","","","","","Columbia University Press","","","","","","","Columbia University Press","","Pages: 320 Pages","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\YECUAFSR\Chenoweth and Stephan - 2011 - Why Civil Resistance Works The Strategic Logic of.pdf","","wisdom; civil resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilized. It was populated with data for both countries and parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control measures. We assumed one Australia to NZ flight per day. Results: When no interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in NZ was estimated to occur after an average time of 1.7 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 0.04-6.09). However, the combined use of exit and entry screening (symptom questionnaire and thermal camera), masks on aircraft and two PCR tests (on days 3 and 12 in NZ), combined with self-reporting of symptoms and contact tracing and mask use until the second PCR test, reduced this risk to one outbreak every 29.8 years (0.8 to 110). If no PCR testing was performed, but mask use was used by passengers up to day 15 in NZ, the risk was one outbreak every 14.1 years. However, 14 days quarantine (NZ practice in May 2020), was the most effective strategy at one outbreak every 34.1 years (0.06 to 125); albeit combined with exit screening and mask use on flights. Conclusions: Policy-makers can require multi-layered interventions to markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus into a COVID-19-free nation via air travel. There is potential to replace 14-day quarantine with PCR testing or interventions involving mask use by passengers in NZ. However, all approaches require continuous careful management and evaluation.</p>","2020-06-14","2020-06-16 09:05:49","2020-06-16 09:05:58","2020-06-16 09:05:49","2020.06.10.20127977","","","","","","Estimating the Impact of Control Measures to Prevent Outbreaks of COVID-19 Associated with Air Travel into a COVID-19-free country","","","","","","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

I would say that this significantly increased my research productivity. I’ve been saying “at least 2x”. Naturally, this sort of thing is difficult to quantify. The truth is, I think it may be more like 3x, especially along the dimension of “producing ideas” and also “early-stage development of ideas”. (What I mean by this will become clearer as I describe how I think about research productivity more generally.) However, it is also very possible that the method produces serious biases in the types of ideas produced/developed, which should be considered. (This would be difficult to quantify at the best of times, but also, it should be noted that other factors have dramatically  decreased my overall research productivity. So, unfortunately, someone looking in from outside would not see an overall boost. Still, my impression is that it's been very useful.) I think there are some specific reasons why Zettelkasten has worked so well for me. I’ll try to make those clear, to help readers decide whether it would work for them. However, I honestly didn’t think Zettelkasten sounded like a good idea before I tried it. It only took me about 30 minutes of working with the cards to decide that it was really good. So, if you’re like me, this is a cheap experiment. I think a lot of people should actually try it to see how they like it, even if it sounds terrible. My plan for this document is to first give a short summary and then an overview of Zettelkasten, so that readers know roughly what I’m talking about, and can possibly experiment with it without reading any further. I’ll then launch into a longer discussion of why it worked well for me, explaining the specific habits which I think contributed, including some descriptions of my previous approaches to keeping research notes.

The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix—a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies—for this purpose.","2005-05","2020-07-27 19:41:57","2020-07-27 19:41:57","2020-07-27 19:41:57","561-566","","5","113","","Environ Health Perspect","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 15866764 PMCID: PMC1257548","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3TAZGAH5\Barnett et al_2005_The Application of the Haddon Matrix to Public Health Readiness and Response.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\2F7ZSCSS\barnett_et_al_2005_the_application_of_the_haddon_matrix_to_public_health_readiness_and_response.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257548/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, heavy metal contamination in the food chain was found to have a deleterious effect on the health of local residents. The levels of copper(Cu), zinc(Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in irrigation water, soil, forages, and animal tissues were measured in samples taken from the vicinity of a smelting facility and control samples. Heavy metal contents in food (corn, rice, and wheat), as well as in human tissues (blood and hair) obtained from local residents were also determined. Hematological values were also determined in human and animal samples. The content of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in irrigation water, soils, and forages were markedly higher in affected areas than in samples from healthy pastures. Concentrations of Cd and Pb were 177.82 and 16.61 times greater in forages than controls, respectively, and 68.71 and 15.66 times greater in soils than controls, respectively. The heavy metal content in food (corn, rice, and wheat) from affected areas was markedly higher than in the control samples. Cd and Pb content in the tissues of affected sheep were markedly higher than in control animals (P < 0.01), while concentrations of Cd and Pb in blood and hair samples from local residents were markedly higher than in control samples (P < 0.01). The occurrence of anemia in affected humans and animals followed a hypochromic and microcytic pattern. The intake of Cd and Pb was estimated according to herbage ingestion rates. It was found that the levels of Cd and Pb which accumulated in sheep through the ingestion of vegetation growing in the sites closest to the smelter were approximately 3.36 and 38.47 mg/kg body wt./day, respectively. Such levels surpassed the fatal dosages for sheep of 1.13 mg Cd/kg body wt/day and 4.42 mg Pb/kg body wt./day. The serum total antioxidant capacity in affected humans and animals was significantly lower than in the controls (P < 0.01). Serum protein parameters in affected humans and animals were significantly reduced (P < 0.01); therefore, it was concluded that heavy metal contamination caused harm to sheep, and also posed a significant risk to humans living in the vicinity of the zinc smelting facility.","2019","2020-07-13 07:21:53","2020-07-13 07:21:53","","e0207423","","10","14","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31658263 PMCID: PMC6816550","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\RQIFFKXI\shen_et_al_2019_the_effect_of_heavy_metal_contamination_on_humans_and_animals_in_the_vicinity.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658263","","Animals; Humans; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; China; Crop Production; Crops, Agricultural; Heavy Metal Poisoning; Metallurgy; Metals, Heavy; Zinc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main outcome variable was the prevalence of frailty (determined by modified Fried criteria). The independent study variables were sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric data and health-related life habits., Results: The study population consisted of 855 individuals (53% women). The overall prevalence of frailty was 26.2% (Gipuzkoa 14.2%, Costa del Sol 38.0%). Using multiple logistic regression, the following factors were associated with frailty: female sex (OR: 1.98; 95%CI: 1.37–2.86); cumulative illness rating scale (OR: 1.05; 95%CI: 1.00–1.10); self-perceived health status (OR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.95–0.97); self-perceived unhealthy lifestyle (OR: 3.37; 95%CI: 2.05–8.87); dissatisfaction with the domestic environment (OR: 2.11; 95%CI: 1.18–3.76); and cognitive impairment (OR: 4.10; 95%CI: 2.05–8.19). In the multivariable model, ‘geographical area’ differences persisted, with an OR of 3.51 (95%CI: 2.29–5.36) for the Costa del Sol area, using Gipuzkoa as reference., Conclusion: In this population of community-dwelling persons aged 70 years and over, the prevalence of frailty was 26%. Factors correlated with frailty were female sex, comorbidity, poorer self-perceived lifestyle and health status, and dissatisfaction with the domestic environment.","2019-10-22","2020-07-13 07:13:27","2020-07-13 07:13:27","2020-07-13 07:13:27","190-196","","4","25","","Eur J Gen Pract","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 31637940 PMCID: PMC6853242","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\4UHR99A3\rivas-ruiz_et_al_2019_prevalence_of_frailty_among_community-dwelling_elderly_persons_in_spain_and.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6853242/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim was to assess the environmental factors associated with the prevalence of eczema among children using a web-based survey. METHODS: In June 2012, we conducted a nation-wide web-based survey to identify the prevalence and characteristics of allergic diseases among Japanese children. The prevalence of allergic diseases including eczema was assessed using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood core questionnaire. The associations between eczema prevalence and environmental factors, as well as those between background characteristics and comorbid allergic diseases among 6-12 year old children were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 28,348 children were included in the analysis. The prevalence of current eczema was 13.0%. Current eczema was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of wheeze, rhinitis, and food allergy. In multiple logistic regression models, birth during autumn (aOR: 1.18 95%CI: 1.06-1.31) or winter (aOR: 1.21 95%CI: 1.08-1.34), duration of exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months (aOR: 1.14 95%CI: 1.06-1.23), and ownership of a pet from infancy (aOR: 2.61 95%CI: 1.68-4.07) were also associated with a higher prevalence of eczema. The prevalence was lower in those with a high annual household income (aOR: 0.90 95%CI: 0.81-0.99) and 2 or more siblings (aOR: 0.86 95%CI: 0.76-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Duration of breastfeeding, season of birth, pet ownership, household income, and the number of siblings were associated with the prevalence of childhood eczema in a nationwide web survey.","2016-10","2020-07-13 07:05:33","2020-07-13 07:05:33","","420-424","","4","65","","Allergol Int","Environmental factors associated with childhood eczema","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27134054","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\NZJB9LQR\sasaki_et_al_2016_environmental_factors_associated_with_childhood_eczema.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27134054","","Epidemiology; Female; Humans; Environment; Risk Factors; Male; Child; Odds Ratio; Internet; Age Factors; Comorbidity; Eczema; Prevalence; Public Health Surveillance; Risk factor; Surveys and Questionnaires; Web survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results suggest that social and environmental determinants, such as general living conditions, occupation and access to protective health care, in the investigated communities, are relevant factors in explaining the observed variability in systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) incidence rates. The study concludes by pointing out the importance and need to consider socio-environmental vulnerability in the elaboration of public health policies and in the management of environmentally protected areas.","2018-05","2020-07-13 07:01:33","2020-07-13 07:01:33","","1425-1436","","5","23","","Cien Saude Colet","","","","","","","","por, eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29768598","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\HQ68F2DQ\mariosa_et_al_2018_influence_of_environmental_conditions_on_the_prevalence_of_systemic.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768598","","Adult; Female; Humans; Environment; Male; Middle Aged; Health Surveys; Adolescent; Young Adult; Aged; Conservation of Natural Resources; Incidence; Health Policy; Public Health; Prevalence; Brazil; Hypertension; Rivers; Social Determinants of Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Framing the research question using the Population; Intervention; Comparator; Outcome; Time frame (PICOT) format in RCTs can improve the quality of the research design. Objectives To evaluate how the PICOT format is used to frame a research question in reports of RCTs of venous ulcer disease and to determine the factors associated with better adherence to the PICOT format in framing the research question. Methods and analyses We will conduct a systematic survey of RCTs on venous ulcers published in the National Institute of Health, PubMed database between January 2009 and May 2016. We will include all RCTs addressing therapeutic intervention for venous ulcer disease involving human subjects, and published in the English language. The selection process will be carried out in duplicate by two independent investigators. First, titles and abstracts will be screened, then full-text articles. We will examine whether the five elements of the PICOT format are used in formulating the research question and give a score between 0 and 5. The primary outcome will be the proportion of studies that have adequately reported all five PICOT elements. Dissemination This will be the first survey to assess how the PICOT format is used to frame research questions on the management of venous ulcers in reports of RCTs. On completion, this review will be submitted to a peer-reviewed biomedical journal for publication and the findings will also be presented at scientific conferences.","2016-11-01","2020-07-11 09:43:31","2020-07-11 09:43:31","2020-07-11 09:43:31","e013175","","11","6","","","Framing of research question using the PICOT format in randomised controlled trials of venous ulcer disease","","","","","","","en","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Population-attributable risk of low birthweight related to PM10 pollution in seven Korean cities. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010; 24: 140–148. To understand the preventable fraction of low birthweight (LBW) deliveries due to maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy in Korea, it is important to quantify the population-attributable risk (PAR). Thus, we investigated the association between maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and LBW, and calculated the PAR for air pollution and LBW in seven Korean cities. We used birth records from the Korean National Birth Register for 2004. A geographic information system and kriging methods were used to construct exposure models. Associations between air pollution and LBW were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, and the PAR for LBW due to air pollution was calculated. Of 177 660 full-term singleton births, 1.4% were LBW. When only spatial variation of air pollution was considered in each city, the adjusted odds ratios unit of particulate matter <10 µm in diameter (PM10) for LBW were 1.08 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99, 1.18] in Seoul, 1.24 [95% CI 1.02, 1.52] in Pusan, 1.19 [95% CI 1.04, 1.37] in Daegu, 1.12 [95% CI 0.98, 1.28] in Incheon, 1.22 [95% CI 0.98, 1.52] in Kwangju, 1.05 [95% CI 1.00, 1.11] in Daejeon and 1.19 [95% CI 1.03, 1.38] in Ulsan. The PARs for LBW attributable to maternal PM10 exposure during pregnancy were 7%, 19%, 16%, 11%, 18%, 5% and 16% respectively. Because a large proportion of pregnant women in Korea are exposed to PM10– which is associated with LBW – a substantial proportion of LBW could be prevented in Korea if air pollution was reduced.","2010","2020-07-09 22:10:54","2020-07-09 22:10:54","2020-07-09 22:10:54","140-148","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 The Authors, Journal Compilation © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3016.2009.01085.x","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\38CF2DZC\seo_et_al_2010_population-attributable_risk_of_low_birthweight_related_to_pm10_pollution_in.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\27TIBKMF\j.1365-3016.2009.01085.html","","","air pollution; low birthweight; particulates; PM10; population-attributable risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We support recent calls for environmental epidemiologists to play a more active role in furthering the global agenda for sustainability, environmental health and equity. We further suggest that the discipline of environmental epidemiology, as well as relevant funding agencies, broaden their focus to include rigorous research on the upstream, larger-scale societal factors that contribute to inequitable patterns of exposure and health outcomes. By widening the scope of our vision and increasing the strength and breadth of the evidence base about how poverty and environment together affect health, we can better participate in efforts to promote social justice and responsible use and protection of the environment, and thus reduce health inequities.

We compared this methodology with two existing approaches—construction of matched cohorts through a common-referent group and a pairwise match for each possible contrast. In a simulation, we varied unmeasured confounding, presence of treatment effect heterogeneity, and the prevalence of treatments and compared each method’s bias, variance, and mean squared error (MSE) of the treatment effect. We applied these techniques to a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, COX-2 selective inhibitors, or opioids.         Results:          We performed 1000 simulation runs. In the base case, we observed an average bias of 0.4% (MSE × 100 = 0.2) in the three-way matching approach and an average bias of 0.3% (MSE × 100 = 0.2) with the pairwise technique. The techniques showed differing bias and MSE with increasing treatment effect heterogeneity and decreasing propensity score overlap. With highly unequal exposure prevalences, strong heterogeneity, and low overlap, we observed a bias of 6.5% (MSE × 100 = 10.8) in the three-way approach and 12.5% (MSE × 100 = 12.3) in the pairwise approach. The empirical study displayed better covariate balance using the pairwise approach. Point estimates were substantially similar.         Conclusions:          Our matching approach offers an effective way to study the safety and effectiveness of three treatment options. We recommend its use over the pairwise or common-referent approaches.","2013-05","2020-07-09 08:43:47","2020-07-09 08:43:47","2020-07-09 08:43:47","401–409","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\9ARUN73S\Matching_by_Propensity_Score_in_Cohort_Studies.12.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models in which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables affected by exposure and disease may often be comparable in size with bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.","2003-05","2020-07-09 08:42:25","2020-07-09 08:42:25","2020-07-09 08:42:25","300–306","","3","14","","","Quantifying Biases in Causal Models","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\VN7G6STR\Quantifying_Biases_in_Causal_Models__Classical.9.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Marginal structural models are a new class of causal models the parameters of which are estimated through inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting; these models allow for appropriate adjustment for confounding. We describe the marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model and use it to estimate the causal effect of zidovudine on the survival of human immunodeficiency virus-positive men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. In this study, CD4 lymphocyte count is both a time-dependent confounder of the causal effect of zidovudine on survival and is affected by past zidovudine treatment. The crude mortality rate ratio (95% confidence interval) for zidovudine was 3.6 (3.0–4.3), which reflects the presence of confounding. After controlling for baseline CD4 count and other baseline covariates using standard methods, the mortality rate ratio decreased to 2.3 (1.9–2.8). Using a marginal structural Cox model to control further for time-dependent confounding due to CD4 count and other time-dependent covariates, the mortality rate ratio was 0.7 (95% conservative confidence interval = 0.6–1.0). We compare marginal structural models with previously proposed causal methods.","2000-09","2020-07-09 08:35:36","2020-07-09 08:35:36","2020-07-09 08:35:36","561–570","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\SZJPLBT7\Marginal_Structural_Models_to_Estimate_the_Causal.12.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration.         Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions.         We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation).         We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.","2010-01","2020-07-09 08:35:01","2020-07-09 08:35:01","2020-07-09 08:35:01","128–138","","1","21","","","Assessing the Performance of Prediction Models","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\UX6MZFX6\Assessing_the_Performance_of_Prediction_Models__A.22.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\B8J3BYM3\steyerberg_et_al_2010_assessing_the_performance_of_prediction_models.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding a study’s data generating structure and translating that data structure into a DAG can be challenging, but these skills are often glossed over in training. Campbell and Stanley’s framework for causal inference has been extraordinarily influential in social science training programs but has received less attention in epidemiology. Their work, along with subsequent revisions and enhancements based on practical experience conducting empirical studies, presents a catalog of 37 threats to validity describing reasons empirical studies may fail to deliver causal effects. We interpret most of these threats to study validity as suggestions for common causal structures. Threats are organized into issues of statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, or external validity. To assist epidemiologists in drawing the correct DAG for their application, we map the correspondence between threats to validity and epidemiologic concepts that can be represented with DAGs. Representing these threats as DAGs makes them amenable to formal analysis with d-separation rules and breaks down cross-disciplinary language barriers in communicating methodologic issues.","2020-05","2020-07-09 08:32:32","2020-07-09 08:32:32","2020-07-09 08:32:32","376–384","","3","31","","","A Graphical Catalog of Threats to Validity","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GN77JZP3\matthay_glymour_2020_a_graphical_catalog_of_threats_to_validity.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\T652NUF8\A_Graphical_Catalog_of_Threats_to_Validity_.11.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First articulated in a 1960 U.S. epidemiology textbook, the 'web' remains a widely accepted but poorly elaborated model, reflecting in part the contemporary stress on epidemiologic methods over epidemiologic theories of disease causation. This essay discusses the origins, features, and problems of the 'web,' including its hidden reliance upon the framework of biomedical individualism to guide the choice of factors incorporated in the 'web.' Posing the question of the whereabouts of the putative 'spider,' the author examines several contemporary approaches to epidemiologic theory, including those which stress biological evolution and adaptation and those which emphasize the social production of disease. To better integrate biologic and social understandings of current and changing population patterns of health and disease, the essay proposes an ecosocial framework for developing epidemiologic theory. Features of this alternative approach are discussed, a preliminary image is offered, and debate is encouraged.","1994-10","2020-07-09 08:23:24","2020-07-09 08:23:24","","887-903","","7","39","","Soc Sci Med","Epidemiology and the web of causation","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 7992123","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\SHJ84522\krieger_1994_epidemiology_and_the_web_of_causation.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7992123","","Humans; Risk Factors; Causality; Epidemiologic Methods; Computer Simulation; Forecasting; Health Services Accessibility; Morbidity; Philosophy, Medical; Social Class; Social Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have described the rationale and interpretation of each method in previous papers of this series, but here we have sought to highlight some of their limitations. We have also suggested alternative methods that can be applied when either the data or a given model is deficient, or when more difficult or specific problems are to be addressed. For example, analysis of recurrent events can make an important contribution to the understanding of the survival process, and so investigating repeat cancer relapses may be more informative than concentrating only on the time until the first. More fundamentally, missing data are a common issue in data collection that in some cases can seriously flaw a proposed analysis. Such considerations may be highly relevant to the analysis of a data set, but are rarely mentioned in the analysis of survival data. One possible reason for this is a perceived lack of computer software, but many of the approaches discussed here are currently incorporated into existing commercial statistical packages (e.g. SAS, S-Plus, Stata) and freeware (e.g. R). On the other hand, the desire may be to ‘keep things simple for the readership’. This view is reasonable, but is valid only where a simple analysis adequately represents the survival experience of patients in the study. Ensuring the analyses are appropriate is therefore crucial. More advanced survival methods can derive more information from the collected data; their use may admittedly convey a less straightforward message, but at the same time could allow a better understanding of the survival process.","2003-09","2020-07-09 06:47:26","2020-07-09 06:47:43","2020-07-09 06:47:26","781-786","","5","89","","Br J Cancer","Survival Analysis Part IV","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\GUZVIIS6\Clark et al. - 2003 - Survival Analysis Part IV Further concepts and me.pdf","","analysis; survival","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reported age-adjusted incidence rates for cancer are still quite low in the demographically young country. Slightly more than 1 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed every year in a population of 1·2 billion. In age-adjusted terms this represents a combined male and female incidence of about a quarter of that recorded in western Europe. However, an estimated 600 000–700 000 deaths in India were caused by cancer in 2012. In age-standardised terms this figure is close to the mortality burden seen in high-income countries. Such figures are partly indicative of low rates of early-stage detection and poor treatment outcomes. Many cancer cases in India are associated with tobacco use, infections, and other avoidable causes. Social factors, especially inequalities, are major determinants of India's cancer burden, with poorer people more likely to die from cancer before the age of 70 years than those who are more affluent. In this first of three papers, we examine the complex epidemiology of cancer, the future burden, and the dominant sociopolitical themes relating to cancer in India.","2014-05-01","2020-07-05 00:55:10","2020-07-05 00:55:10","2020-07-05 00:55:10","e205-e212","","6","15","","The Lancet Oncology","The growing burden of cancer in India","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\57VREIHQ\mallath_et_al_2014_the_growing_burden_of_cancer_in_india.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\H6XP7ZF9\S1470204514701159.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design A randomized controlled trial with group allocation single-blinded to the assessor. Setting Community centers, malls, and outdoor parks. Participants Nonfallers with Parkinson disease (PD) (N=70; mean age ± SD, 61.2±8.8y) randomly assigned to either a balance (BAL) group (n=32) or a control (CON) group (n=38). Interventions The BAL group received 4 weeks of indoor and 4 weeks of outdoor balance training (with a 2-h session per week). The CON group received 8 weeks of upper limb training at the same dosage. Both groups were instructed to perform 3 hours of home exercise weekly posttraining. Main Outcome Measures (1) Dynamic balance performance: Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest); (2) Functional performance: functional reach (FR), 5 times sit-to-stand (FTSTS), 1-leg-stance (OLS), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and dual-task TUG tests; (3) Fall-related outcomes: ratios of total nonfallers to fallers and noninjurious fallers to injurious fallers, total and injurious fall rates, times to first falls and injurious falls. Results Sixty-eight participants completed training. A total of 7 patients (10%) withdrew before the 6-month follow-up, but not because of any adverse effects. At immediate and 6 months posttraining, the BAL group showed significantly greater improvements (from baseline) than the CON group in Mini-BESTest total scores, FR distances, and OLS times, together with greater time reductions in FTSTS, TUG, and dual-task TUG tests (all P<.05). The number of injurious fallers was significantly lower in the BAL group at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions This task- and context-specific balance training program improved the dynamic balance and fall-prone functional performance of PD nonfallers for up to 6 months after training. The BAL group showed a reduction in injurious fallers.","2015-12-01","2020-06-22 22:13:29","2020-06-22 22:13:29","2020-06-22 22:13:29","2103-2111","","12","96","","Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation","Task- and Context-Specific Balance Training Program Enhances Dynamic Balance and Functional Performance in Parkinsonian Nonfallers","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\R7IF7FWI\S0003999315010758.html; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\UAW7VDXF\wong-yu_mak_2015_task-_and_context-specific_balance_training_program_enhances_dynamic_balance.pdf","","","Randomized controlled trial; Accidental falls; Exercise therapy; Parkinson disease; Postural balance; Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine the reactive recovery responses used to maintain dynamic stability during an unexpected slip, establish the time course of response adaptation to repeated slip perturbations, and distinguish the proactive strategies for negotiating a slippery surface. Twelve young adults participated in the study in which a slip was generated following foot contact on a set of steel free-wheeling rollers. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and the medial head of gastrocnemius on the perturbed limb. Whole body kinematics were recorded using an optical imaging system: from this the center of mass, foot angle, and medial-lateral stability margins were determined. In addition, braking/loading and accelerating/unloading impulses while in contact with the rollers and the rate of loading the rollers were determined from ground reaction forces. Results demonstrate that the reactive recovery response to the first slip consisted of a rapid onset of a flexor synergy (146–199 ms), a large arm elevation strategy, and a modified swing limb trajectory. With repeated exposure to the slip perturbation, the CNS rapidly adapts within one slip trial through global changes. These changes include the attenuation of muscle response magnitude, reduced braking impulse, landing more flat-footed, and elevating the center of mass. Individuals implement a “surfing strategy” while on the rollers when knowledge of the surface condition was available before hand. Furthermore, knowledge of a slip results in a reduced braking impulse and rate of loading, a shift in medial-lateral center of mass closer to the support limb at foot contact on the rollers and a more flat foot landing. In conclusion, prior experience with the perturbations allows subsequent modification and knowledge of the surface condition results in proactive adjustments to safely traverse the slippery surface.","2002-07-01","2020-06-22 22:10:02","2020-06-22 22:10:02","2020-06-22 22:10:02","339-353","","1","88","","Journal of Neurophysiology","Strategies for Dynamic Stability During Locomotion on a Slippery Surface","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\J4FN49ZH\marigold_patla_2002_strategies_for_dynamic_stability_during_locomotion_on_a_slippery_surface.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation—genetic liability—has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.","2020-07-24","2020-07-28 21:40:43","2020-07-28 21:40:43","2020-07-28 21:40:43","1-14","","","","","","Tutorial","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\BP32ZJ7R\Choi et al_2020_Tutorial.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\RN8PR6YY\s41596-020-0353-1.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There has been little adoption of LHS in practice due to challenges and barriers that limit adoption of new data-driven technologies in healthcare. We have identified a more fundamental explanation: the majority of developments in LHS are not identified as LHS. The absence of a unifying namespace and framework brings a lack of consistency in how LHS is identified and classified. As a result, the LHS ‘community’ is fragmented, with groups working on similar systems being unaware of each other’s work. This leads to duplication and the lack of a critical mass of researchers necessary to address barriers to adoption.","2018-04","2020-08-13 23:30:41","2020-08-13 23:30:41","2020-08-13 23:30:40","77-87","","2","25","","BMJ Health Care Inform","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\PMP3DQIY\McLachlan et al. - 2018 - The Heimdall framework for supporting characterisa.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods for conducting, interpreting and reporting overviews are in their infancy. To date, there has been no evidence map of the methods used in overviews, thus making it difficult to determine the gaps and priorities for methods research. Our objectives were to develop and populate a comprehensive framework of methods for conducting, interpreting and reporting overviews (stage I) and to create an evidence map by mapping studies that have evaluated overview methods to the framework (stage II). Methods We searched methods collections (e.g. Cochrane Methodology Register, Meth4ReSyn library, AHRQ Effective Health Care Program) to identify eligible studies for both stages of this research. In stage I, cross-sectional studies, guidance documents and commentaries that described methods proposed for, or used in, overviews were used to develop and populate the framework of methods. Drafts and multiple iterations of the framework were discussed and refined by all authors. In stage II, we identified and described studies evaluating overview methods and mapped these evaluations to the framework. Results In this paper, we present results for the four initial steps of conducting an overview: (a) specification of the purpose, objectives and scope, (b) specification of the eligibility criteria, (c) search methods and (d) data extraction. Twenty-nine studies mentioned or described methods relevant to one or more of these steps. In the developed framework, identified methods and approaches were grouped according to the steps an overview author would need to undertake. Fifteen studies evaluated identified methods, all of which mapped to the search methods step. These studies either reported the development and evaluation of a new search filter to retrieve systematic reviews or compared the performance of multiple filters. Conclusion Gaps in the evaluation of methods were found for the majority of steps in the framework. More empirical studies are needed to evaluate the methods outlined and provide a comprehensive evidence map. The framework is useful for planning these evaluations and for planning methods required to deal with challenges that arise when conducting an overview.

The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting changes in society due to social distancing measures, has showcased inequities in access to decent work and experiences of discrimination resulting in many of the vulnerable populations in the United States experiencing a much harsher impact on economic and work-related factors. The purpose of this essay is to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic may differentially affect workers of color, individuals from low-income backgrounds, and women in complex ways. First, this essay will discuss disproportionate representation of workers from low-income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds in sectors most affected by COVID-19. Second, it will discuss the lack of decent work for low-income workers who perform “essential” tasks. Third, this essay will highlight economic and work-related implications of increased discrimination Asian Americans are experiencing in society. Finally, role conflict and stress for women who are managing additional unpaid work, including caretaking responsibilities, while needing to continue to engage in paid work will be examined. A research agenda will be set forth throughout the essay, calling for vocational psychologists to engage in research that fully examines how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting vulnerable communities.","2020-06-01","2020-09-24 06:00:49","2020-09-24 06:00:49","2020-09-24 06:00:49","103439","","","119","","Journal of Vocational Behavior","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized populations in the United States","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\JJGV6SX4\Kantamneni_2020_The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized populations in the United.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\4HJLKACS\S0001879120300646.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each study divides the population into ""income"" quintiles, estimated using consumption expenditures. The studies measure inequality in the use of and spending on health services. Richer groups are found to have a higher probability of obtaining care when sick, to be more likely to be seen by a doctor, and to have a higher probability of receiving medicines when they are ill, than the poorer groups. The richer also spend more in absolute terms on care. In several instances there are unexpected findings. There is no consistent pattern in the use of private providers. Richer households do not devote a consistently higher percentage of their consumption expenditures to health care. The analyses indicate that intuition concerning inequalities could result in misguided decisions. It would thus be worthwhile to measure inequality to inform policy-making.

The authors seek to decompose the inequalities in health status into their socioeconomic causes. In this decomposition, inequalities in health status depend on inequalities in each of the underlying determinants of health and on the elasticities of health status with respect to each of these determinants. The authors estimate these elasticities using regression models that allow for unobserved heterogeneity at the community level. They find that inequalities in unobserved community-level influences account for only 6 percent of health inequality, and inequalities in parental education and social class for only 4 percent. Inequalities in income and housing tenure account for most health inequality, though inequalities in educational attainment and in math scores at age seven also play a part.","2001-11-30","2020-09-24 10:17:30","2020-09-24 10:17:30","2020-09-24 10:17:30","","","","","","","Causes of Inequality in Health","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\FPSPL6YM\papers.html","","","Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems; Disease Control & Prevention; Early Child and Children's Health; Gender and Health; Health Monitoring & Evaluation; Health Systems Development & Reform; Housing & Human Habitats; Public Health Promotion; Regional Rural Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2443998","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design, setting and participants: Analysis of data from the World Development Indicators 2003 database, compiled by the World Bank. Main outcome measures: Adult and child mortality among countries placed into distinct mortality categories by cluster analysis. Results: 29 countries had a high adult mortality (mean 584/1000; range 460/1000 to 725/1000) and 23 had a high child mortality (mean 207/1000, range 160/1000 to 316/1000). All these countries were in western and sub-Saharan Africa and Afghanistan. Bivariate analyses showed that relative to countries with low child mortality, those with high child mortality had significantly higher rates of extreme poverty (p<0.001), populations living in rural areas (p<0.001) and female illiteracy (p<0.001), significantly lower per capita expenditure on healthcare (p<0.001), outpatient visits, hospital beds and doctors, and lower rates of access to improved water (p<0.001), sanitation (p<0.001) and immunisations. In multivariate analyses, countries with high adult mortality had a higher prevalence of HIV infection (odds ratio per 1% increase 18.6; 95% CI 0.3 to 1135.5). Between 1960 and 2000, adult male mortality in countries with high mortality increased at >4 times the rate in countries with low mortality. For child mortality, the worse-off group made slower progress in reducing <5 mortality than the better-off group. Conclusions: Inequalities in child and adult mortality are large, are growing, and are related to several economic, social and health sector variables. Global efforts to deal with this problem require attention to the worse-off countries, geographic concentrations, and adopt a multidimensional approaches to development.","2006-11-01","2020-09-24 10:22:28","2020-09-24 10:22:28","2020-09-24 10:22:28","928-936","","11","60","","","Global health inequalities","","","","","","","en","Copyright 2006 Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health","","","","jech.bmj.com","","Publisher: BMJ Publishing Group Ltd Section: Research report PMID: 17053281","","; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\8BUYKGI5\Ruger_Kim_2006_Global health inequalities.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DP6ZJGLX\928.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17053281","","CPI, consumer price index; GDP, gross domestic product; GNI, gross national income; PPP, purchasing power parity; WDI, World Development Indicators; WHO, World Health Organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is concerned with testing the explanatory power of three widely proposed causal explanations for social inequality in health in adulthood: the social causation hypothesis (SEP determines health), the health selection hypothesis (health determines SEP) and the indirect selection hypothesis (no causal relationship). We employ dynamic data of respondents aged 30 to 60 from the last nine waves of the British Household Panel Survey. Household income and location on the Cambridge Scale is included as measures of different dimensions of SEP and health is measured as a latent factor score. The causal hypotheses are tested using a time-based Granger approach by estimating dynamic fixed effects panel regression models following the method suggested by Anderson and Hsiao. We propose using this method to estimate the associations over time since it allows one to control for all unobserved time-invariant factors and hence lower the chances of biased estimates due to unobserved heterogeneity. The results showed no proof of the social causation hypothesis over a one to five year period and limited support for the health selection hypothesis was seen only for men in relation to HH income. These findings were robust in multiple sensitivity analysis. We conclude that the indirect selection hypothesis may be the most important in explaining social inequality in health in adulthood, indicating that the well-known cross-sectional correlations between health and SEP in adulthood seem not to be driven by a causal relationship, but instead by dynamics and influences in place before the respondents turn 30 years old that affect both their health and SEP onwards. The conclusion is limited in that we do not consider the effect of specific diseases and causal relationships in adulthood may be present over a longer timespan than 5 years.","2016-02-01","2020-09-24 10:26:46","2020-09-24 10:26:46","2020-09-24 10:26:46","172-183","","","150","","Social Science & Medicine","Socioeconomic inequality in health in the British household panel","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\T2FZAWDD\S0277953615302811.html","","","Causality; Anderson-Hsiao; British household panel survey; Fixed effects models; Health selection; Panel models; Social causation; Social inequality in health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite considerable achievements associated with the MDG approach, which entails international and national target setting and monitoring, a sharp distinction between areas of social policy is entailed. In addition the approach suggests sufficiency, for example providing a minimum level of education or gender parity, rather than a fuller notion of equality, is good enough. These processes of classification, which entail horizontal and vertical boundaries, are examined, partly drawing on Bernsteinian ideas, and partly through reflections on the concept of intersectionality.

Despite considerable achievements associated with the MDG approach, which entails international and national target setting and monitoring, a sharp distinction between areas of social policy is entailed. In addition the approach suggests sufficiency, for example providing a minimum level of education or gender parity, rather than a fuller notion of equality, is good enough. These processes of classification, which entail horizontal and vertical boundaries, are examined, partly drawing on Bernsteinian ideas, and partly through reflections on the concept of intersectionality.

Disease burden is also disproportionately distributed, with marginalized groups having the highest risk of poor health outcomes. Social determinants are thought to influence health care delivery and the management of chronic diseases among marginalized groups, but the current conceptualization of social determinants lacks a critical focus on the experiences of people within their environment. The purpose of this article was to integrate the literature on marginalization and situate the concept in the framework of social determinants of health. We demonstrate that social position links marginalization and social determinants of health. This perspective provides a critical lens to assess the societal power dynamics that influence the construction of the socio-environmental factors affecting health. Linking marginalization with social determinants of health can improve our understanding of the inequities in health care delivery and the disparities in chronic disease burden among vulnerable groups.","2019","2020-09-25 04:24:37","2020-09-25 04:24:40","2020-09-25 04:24:37","e12268","","1","26","","","Marginalization","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nin.12268","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\NX9DZDTK\Baah et al_2019_Marginalization.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LK94WI3A\nin.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the Index of Vulnerability (IoV), a quantitative yet anthropologically-informed method connecting social-ecological systems to mental and physical health outcomes. The IoV combines measures of five life domains; food insecurity, water insecurity, access to healthcare, social support, and social status. Scores on this index increase for each life domain where the individual falls into a “high risk” category. Thus, individuals with the highest IoV scores are those who are at risk across multiple life domains. This approach makes the IoV malleable to local contexts, as scholars can choose which measure of each life domain is most appropriate for their study population. An anthropological study conducted among 225 Awajún adults living in the Peruvian Amazon from March to November of 2013 showed that men with higher IoV scores had significantly lower summary fat skinfolds, lower triglyceride levels, and a greater probability of reporting moderate to severe somatic symptoms and poor perceived health. Awajún women with higher IoV scores had significantly elevated perceived stress levels and a greater probability of reporting poor perceived health and moderate to severe somatic and depressive symptoms. Importantly, comparing the IoV to its constituent parts shows that it predicts a wider range of mental and physical health outcomes than any of the life domains alone. The IoV is presented here in relation to the broader political-economic and cultural context of the Awajún, forwarding a critical biocultural approach within anthropology, and demonstrating the IoV’s utility for other scholars and practitioners.","2016-08-01","2020-09-25 04:35:33","2020-09-25 04:35:33","2020-09-25 04:35:33","68-78","","","162","","Social Science & Medicine","The Index of Vulnerability","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\ZMWU32M7\S0277953616302970.html","","","Health; Amazon; Anthropology; Awajún; Critical biocultural approach; Vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The steps in an assessment should include the following: a) determine the scope of the assessment; b) describe the current distribution and burden of climate-sensitive health determinants and outcomes; c) identify and describe current strategies, policies, and measures designed to reduce the burden of climate-sensitive health determinants and outcomes; d) review the health implications of the potential impacts of climate variability and change in other sectors; e) estimate the future potential health impacts using scenarios of future changes in climate, socioeconomic, and other factors; f) synthesize the results; and g) identify additional adaptation policies and measures to reduce potential negative health impacts.

Certain outcomes (such as mortality, injury and cardiovascular disease risk factors) revealed inconsistent results, but these were rarely studied. Despite the frequency of post-disaster relocation and evidence of its effect on psychological morbidity, there is a relative paucity of studies; the few examples in the literature reveal weak study designs, inconsistent results, and inattention to physical health impacts and the challenges facing vulnerable populations.

In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. Findings Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43–63), and 20 (58·8%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]). 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury. Interpretation In this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44·1%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20·5%.

Methods We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","2020-04-01","2020-09-25 22:15:54","2020-09-25 22:15:54","2020-09-25 22:15:54","284-286","","","93","","International Journal of Infectious Diseases","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\EFWQXZZZ\Nishiura et al_2020_Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LG42DDA4\S1201971220301193.html","","","Epidemiology; Coronavirus; Viruses; Generation time; Illness onset; Outbreak; Statistical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. Setting International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. Participants Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. Primary outcome measures Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. Results The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. Conclusions The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.","2020-08-01","2020-09-25 22:20:06","2020-09-25 22:20:06","2020-09-25 22:20:06","e039652","","8","10","","","Incubation period of COVID-19","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.","2020-04-01","2020-09-25 22:21:28","2020-09-25 22:21:28","2020-09-25 22:21:27","281-286","","4","87","","Indian J Pediatr","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\EDJSJXAT\Singhal_2020_A Review of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19).pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.</p>","2020-03-06","2020-09-25 22:26:15","2020-09-25 22:26:15","2020-09-25 22:26:15","2020.03.03.20029983","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days. The basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions.

Firms have cut back on postings for high-skill jobs more than for low-skill jobs, with small firms nearly halting their new hiring altogether. New-hiring cuts and downskilling are most pronounced in local labor markets lacking depth (where employment is concentrated within a few firms), in low-income areas, and in areas with greater income inequality. Cuts are deeper in industries where workers are more unionized and in the non-tradable sector. Access to finance modulates corporate hiring, with credit-constrained firms curtailing their job postings the most. Our study shows how the early-2020 global pandemic is shaping the dynamics of hiring, identifying the firms, jobs, places, industries, and labor markets most affected by it. Our results point to important challenges to the scale and speed of a recovery.","2020-05","2020-09-26 00:35:02","2020-09-26 00:35:02","2020-09-26 00:35:01","","","","","","","Corporate Hiring under COVID-19","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","Series: Working Paper Series DOI: 10.3386/w27208","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\V4QINP6G\Campello et al_2020_Corporate Hiring under COVID-19.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3·0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, UK Department for International Development, and Medical Research Council.</p>","2020-09-01","2020-09-26 00:58:27","2020-09-26 00:58:27","2020-09-26 00:58:27","e1132-e1141","","9","8","","The Lancet Global Health","Potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 32673577","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\46AWZJA2\Hogan et al_2020_Potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in.pdf; ; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\CZWTY6YV\fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32673577","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that the economic shocks associated to the COVID-19 epidemic—shutdowns, layoffs, and firm exits—may have this feature. In one-sector economies supply shocks are never Keynesian. We show that this is a general result that extend to economies with incomplete markets and liquidity constrained consumers. In economies with multiple sectors Keynesian supply shocks are possible, under some conditions. A 50% shock that hits all sectors is not the same as a 100% shock that hits half the economy. Incomplete markets make the conditions for Keynesian supply shocks more likely to be met. Firm exit and job destruction can amplify the initial effect, aggravating the recession. We discuss the effects of various policies. Standard fiscal stimulus can be less effective than usual because the fact that some sectors are shut down mutes the Keynesian multiplier feedback. Monetary policy, as long as it is unimpeded by the zero lower bound, can have magnified effects, by preventing firm exits. Turning to optimal policy, closing down contact-intensive sectors and providing full insurance payments to affected workers can achieve the first-best allocation, despite the lower per-dollar potency of fiscal policy.","2020-04","2020-09-26 05:03:44","2020-09-26 05:03:44","2020-09-26 05:03:44","","","","","","","Macroeconomic Implications of COVID-19","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","Series: Working Paper Series DOI: 10.3386/w26918","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\UHP9SB4P\Guerrieri et al_2020_Macroeconomic Implications of COVID-19.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26918","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show how these new fissures interact with existing inequalities along various key dimensions, including socio-economic status, education, age, gender, ethnicity and geography. We find that the deep underlying inequalities and policy challenges that we already had are crucial in understanding the complex impacts of the pandemic itself and our response to it, and that the crisis does in itself have the potential to exacerbate some of these pre-existing inequalities fairly directly. Moreover, it seems likely that the current crisis will leave legacies that will impact inequalities in the long term. These possibilities are not all disequalising, but many are.","2020","2020-09-26 05:05:01","2020-09-26 05:05:01","2020-09-26 05:05:01","291-319","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Authors.

This paper draws on the literature on disability, poverty and social protection in low- and middle-income countries to explore the pathways through which the current pandemic may increase the risk of poverty amongst people with disabilities, such as loss of income from disruptions to work, particularly in the informal sector, and higher future spending and productivity losses from disruptions to healthcare and other key services (e.g. rehabilitation, assistive devices). It also explores how social protection and other initiatives to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic should consider the needs of people with disabilities, with recommendations for disability-inclusive actions in the design and implementation of eligibility criteria and application procedures, as well as the delivery and content of benefits. Across recommendations, meaningful consultations with people with disabilities, leadership at the program and policy level, appropriate budgeting and monitoring of progress through routine collection of data on disability are key for improving access to and impact of economic responses amongst people with disabilities.","2021-01-01","2020-09-26 05:08:00","2020-09-26 05:08:00","2020-09-26 05:08:00","105178","","","137","","World Development","Disability-inclusive responses to COVID-19","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DGF7QKTQ\Banks et al_2021_Disability-inclusive responses to COVID-19.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\TNZD8I2E\S0305750X20303053.html","","","COVID-19; Poverty; Disability; Low- and middle-income countries; Social protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We used enHealth Guidelines (2002) as our risk assessment tool. Laboratory test results for nickel in water samples were compared with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines 2004 and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality 2005. Results: The mean nickel concentration in the drinking water samples tested over a 4-year period (2002–2005) was 0.03 mg/L (95% CI: 0.02–0.04). The average daily consumption of two litres of water by a 70-kg adult provided 0.06 mg (0.03 mg ϫ 2) of nickel, which was only 7% of the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) based on experiments on nickelsensitive people in a fasting state.

It is the product of significant revisions to clarify and elaborate on ways of implementing its recommendations of contextual hazard identification and risk management, through the establishment of health-based targets, catchment-to-consumer water safety plans and independent surveillance. It reflects the renewed focus on primary prevention. Significant additional guidance on good practice is presented, incorporating changes introduced by the first and second addenda to the third edition. Emerging water management issues are comprehensively addressed for a range of circumstances, from household water treatment and safe storage and the bulk supply of water over long distances to the potential implications of climate change. Additional risk assessments are presented for a number of new chemical and microbial hazards and applied to a suite of pesticides used for public health purposes. Existing reviews on chemicals and waterborne pathogens have been revised to account for new scientific information. The chapter on radiological aspects of drinking-water quality has been comprehensively updated. Even more than the previous edition, this new edition incorporating the first addendum, emphasizes achievable practices and the formulation of sound regulations, applicable to low-income, middle-income and industrialized countries alike, that aim to prevent a potential health crisis caused by the consumption of unsafe drinking-water, against the backdrop of rapid urbanization, water scarcity and climate change.","2017","2020-10-06 22:33:45","2020-10-06 22:33:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 975491910","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\45PPM9K4\World Health Organization - 2017 - Guidelines for drinking-water quality..pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To integrate these new discoveries with emerging models of asthma pathobiology, we aimed to test how genetic discoveries relate to developmental and biological characteristics of asthma.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated a multilocus profile of genetic risk derived from published GWAS of asthma case status. We then tested associations between this genetic risk score and developmental and biological characteristics of asthma in participants enrolled in a population-based long-running birth cohort, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (n=1037). We used data on asthma onset, asthma persistence, atopy, airway hyper-responsiveness, incompletely reversible airflow obstruction, and asthma-related school and work absenteeism and hospital admissions obtained during nine prospective assessments spanning the ages of 9 to 38 years. Analyses included cohort members of European descent from whom genetic data had been obtained.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Of the 880 cohort members included in our analysis, those at higher genetic risk developed asthma earlier in life than did those with lower genetic risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1·12, 95% CI 1·01–1·26). Of cohort members with childhood-onset asthma, those with higher genetic risk were more likely to develop life-course-persistent asthma than were those with a lower genetic risk (relative risk [RR] 1·36, 95% CI 1·14–1·63). Participants with asthma at higher genetic risk more often had atopy (RR 1·07, 1·01–1·14), airway hyper-responsiveness (RR 1·16, 1·03–1·32), and incompletely reversible airflow obstruction (RR 1·28, 1·04–1·57) than did those with a lower genetic risk. They were also more likely to miss school or work (incident rate ratio 1·38, 1·02–1·86) and be admitted to hospital (HR 1·38, 1·07–1·79) because of asthma.

This manuscript revisits the work of renowned educator Benjamin S. Bloom, who saw reducing gaps in the achievement of various groups of students as a simple problem of reducing variation in student learning outcomes. Bloom observed that teaching all students in the same way and giving all the same time to learn?that is, providing little variation in the instruction?typically results in great variation in student learning. Students for whom the instructional methods and amount of time are appropriate learn well, and those for whom the methods and time are less appropriate learn less well. Bloom believed that all students could be helped to reach a high criterion of learning if both the instructional methods and time were varied to better match students' individual learning needs. In other words, to reduce variation in the achievement of diverse groups of students and have all students learn well, Bloom argued that educators and teachers must increase variation in instructional approaches and learning time. Bloom labeled the strategy to accomplish this instructional variation and differentiation mastery learning. Research evidence shows that the positive effects of mastery learning are not limited to cognitive or achievement outcomes. The process also yields improvements in students' confidence in learning situations, school attendance rates, involvement in class sessions, attitudes toward learning, and a variety of other affective measures.","2007-11-01","2020-10-21 23:10:21","2020-10-21 23:10:21","2020-10-21 23:10:21","8-31","","1","19","","Journal of Advanced Academics","Closing Achievement Gaps","","","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\WSV6JYYI\Guskey_2007_Closing Achievement Gaps.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This construct was articulated to support and strengthen doctoral education. The purpose of this paper is to expand the construct of stewardship so that it can be applied to both scholars and non-academic practitioners, and can be initiated earlier than doctoral education. To accomplish and justify this, we describe a general developmental trajectory supporting cross-curriculum teaching for stewardship of a discipline as well as of a profession. We argue that the most important features of stewardship, comprising the public trust for the future of their discipline or profession, are obtainable by all practitioners, and are not limited to those who have completed doctoral training. The developmental trajectory is defined using the Mastery Rubric construct, which requires articulating the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be targeted with a curriculum; recognizable stages of performance of these KSAs; and performance level descriptors of each KSA at each stage. Concrete KSAs of stewardship that can be taught and practiced throughout the career (professional or scholarly) were derived directly from the original definition. We used the European guild structure’s stages of Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master for the trajectory, and through a consensus-based standard setting exercise, created performance level descriptors featuring development of Bloom’s taxonometric cognitive abilities (see Appendix A) for each KSA. Together, these create the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship (MR-S). The MR-S articulates how stewardly behavior can be cultivated and documented for individuals in any disciplinary curriculum, whether research-intensive (preparing “scholars”) or professional (preparing members of a profession or more generally for the work force). We qualitatively assess the validity of the MR-S by examining its applicability to, and concordance with professional practice standards in three diverse disciplinary examples: (1) History; (2) Statistics and Data Science; and (3) Neurosciences. These domains differ dramatically in terms of content and methodologies, but students in each discipline could either continue on to doctoral training and scholarship, or utilize doctoral or pre-doctoral training in other professions. The MR-S is highly aligned with the practice standards of all three of these domains, suggesting that stewardship can be meaningfully cultivated and utilized by those working in or outside of academia, supporting the initiation of stewardship prior to doctoral training and for all students, not only those who will earn PhDs or be scholars first and foremost. The MR-S can be used for curriculum development or revision in order to purposefully promote stewardship at all levels of higher education and beyond. The MR-S renders features of professional stewardship accessible to all practitioners, enabling formal and informal, as well as self-directed, development and refinement of a professional identity.","2019-12","2020-10-22 22:25:45","2020-10-22 22:25:45","2020-10-22 22:25:45","292","","4","9","","","The Preparation of Stewards with the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\EC2NDA5S\Rios et al_2019_The Preparation of Stewards with the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\8US7ZE8X\292.html","","","actionable evidence of learning; curriculum development and evaluation; Mastery Rubric; professional development; professional identity; stewardship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are constructed by individuals based on their unique life experiences, perceptions, and understandings of the world. Mental models are used to reason and make decisions and can be the basis of individual behaviors. They provide the mechanism through which new information is filtered and stored. Recognizing and dealing with the plurality of stakeholder’s perceptions, values, and goals is currently considered a key aspect of effective natural resource management (NRM) practice. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of how mental models internally represent complex, dynamic systems and how these representations change over time will allow us to develop mechanisms to enhance effective management and use of natural resources. Realizing this potential, however, relies on developing and testing adequate tools and techniques to elicit these internal representations of the world effectively. This paper provides an interdisciplinary synthesis of the literature that has contributed to the theoretical development and practical application of the mental model construct. It explores the utility and applicability of the construct in the context of NRM and includes a review of elicitation techniques used within the field. The major theoretical and practical challenges that arise in drawing on the construct to provide a cognitive dimension to NRM are also addressed.","2011","2020-10-22 23:22:50","2020-10-22 23:22:50","2020-10-22 23:22:50","art46","","1","16","","E&S","Mental Models","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\S2ZGR2W9\Jones et al. - 2011 - Mental Models An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of T.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bloom argued that to reduce variation in students' achievement and to have all students learn well, we must increase variation in instructional approaches and learning time. The key element in this effort is well constructed, formative classroom assessments. Bloom outlined a specific strategy for using formative classroom assessments to guide teachers in differentiating their instruction and labeled it ""mastery learning.""

Expert performance can, however, be traced to active engagement in deliberate practice (DP), where training (often designed and arranged by their teachers and coaches) is focused on improving particular tasks. DP also involves the provision of immediate feedback, time for problem-solving and evaluation, and opportunities for repeated performance to refine behavior.

These include contrasts between performances and products, between assessment of performance per se and performance assessment of competence or other constructs, between structured and unstructured problems and response modes, and between breadth and depth of domain coverage. These distinctions are elaborated in the context of an overarching contrast between task-driven and construct-driven performance assessment. Rhetoric touting performance assessments because they eschew decomposed skills and decontextualized tasks is viewed as misguided, in that component skills and abstract problems have a legitimate place in pedagogy. Hence, the essence of authentic assessment must be sought elsewhere, that is, in the quest for complete construct representation. With this background, the concepts of “authenticity” and “directness” of performance assessment are treated as tantamount to promissory validity claims that they offset, respectively, the two major threats to construct validity, namely, construct underrepresentation and construct-irrelevant variance. With respect to validation, the salient role of both positive and negative consequences is underscored as well as the need, as in all assessment, for evidence of construct validity.","1994-03-01","2020-10-23 07:01:17","2020-10-23 07:01:17","2020-10-23 07:01:16","13-23","","2","23","","Educational Researcher","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: American Educational Research Association","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DIM44RWM\Messick_1994_The Interplay of Evidence and Consequences in the Validation of Performance.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve it through collective action, collective motivation is required. Yet, given the complexity and scale of the collective problem, it may be difficult for individuals to experience such motivation. Intriguingly, the experience of hope may increase collective motivation and action. We offer an integrative coping perspective on hope and collective action in the context of climate change. It explains how hope stimulates individuals’ collective motivation to act against climate change (serving a problem-focused coping function), or fails to do so (serving an emotion-focused coping function). Testing these competing hypotheses, we conducted three studies that experimentally manipulated a core antecedent of hope (i.e., the perceived possibility of change) among US participants (total N = 1020). Across the board, this manipulation increased individuals’ hope but not their collective motivation and action. Furthermore, collective motivation predicted collective action intentions across all three studies. Hoping thus seems to serve an emotion-focused coping function and hence may not increase the collective motivation required for collective action in the context of climate change.","2019-09-01","2020-10-31 00:18:54","2020-10-31 00:18:54","2020-10-31 00:18:54","101915","","","58","","Global Environmental Change","Is hope good for motivating collective action in the context of climate change?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\DNCZD743\S0959378018313608.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research examines how a communication training program for environmental educators working at aquariums, zoos, and national parks might boost this population's willingness to discuss climate change with visitors via increasing hope. Using hope theory, we examined whether changes in the two components of hope – agency (the will; sense of successful determination) and pathways (the ways; the perception that one can generate a diversity of routes to one's goal, even when encountering barriers) – mediated increases in participants' self-reported discussion of climate change following the training program. Participants (environmental educators; N = 211) completed surveys before, immediately after (mediators only), and six months following (outcome only) a training program. Although having greater agency predicted frequency of climate change discussions (i.e., at the between-person level), (within-person) increases in agency did not lead to increases in discussion or mediate the effect of the intervention on discussion. Instead, increases in pathways thinking mediated the effect of the intervention on increased discussion. Our results indicate that, at least among those who already have the desire to discuss climate change more, interventions which instill hope toward such discussions, and specifically, focus on building a greater variety of methods of engaging in the discussions and responding to obstacles (i.e., pathways thinking), have the potential to promote more extensive public discourse on the topic.","2019-12-01","2020-10-31 00:23:50","2020-10-31 00:23:50","2020-10-31 00:23:50","101366","","","66","","Journal of Environmental Psychology","Untangling the components of hope","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\M8KQCVJB\S0272494418308545.html","","","Intervention; Civic engagement; Climate change discussion; Hope; Within-person change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report two studies that investigate hope as a motivational resource during times when the odds of success seem low. We argue that when people are personally invested in the cause, their hope leaps with emerging possibility (low likelihood) of a positive outcome, but linearly aligns with likelihood for more probable outcomes (i.e., hope is a cubic function of likelihood). Crucially, hope then motivates support for collective action, in this case support for climate action, thus illuminating the possible antecedents for collective action against the odds. In Study 1, with a highly invested sample, hope mediated the relationship between cubic likelihood and support for climate change action. Study 2 extended these findings, showing that for individuals strongly invested in the outcome (but not for those less invested), hope arose with possibility but not probability of success, leading to greater support for climate change action. Hope's unique motivational role arises when the odds are low, when success is only possible rather than probable.

M.","Using the Story of a Gallon of Gasoline to Astound, Scare, and Build the Hope and Courage Necessary to Face Climate Change","AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts","","","","http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFMPA13A..06D","It is difficult to teach for both understanding and application, and the  climate crisis highlights this in profound ways. Even those who understand the extreme threats posed by anthropogenic climate change have been largely at a loss for how to generate a response to such threats at scale. What drives people, organizations and governments to actually act in the face of crisis? In at least several historical examples, the impetus for action includes being astounded and scared while also having reason for hope and the ability to display courage. These steps are infused with building visceral understanding of the problems' magnitude. Examples that follow this pattern include US involvement in World War II, the Apollo Program, and the civil rights movement. ""Where Does Gasoline Go?"" and ""Fire & Brimstone & Fort McMurray"" are presentations that, when brought together apply this framework to climate change communication. Americans burn 391 million gallons of gasoline per day, each containing 5.5 pounds of carbon. To sequester that carbon by tree-planting requires the equivalent of growing a 2x4 for each gallon. If the US were to offset current emissions from gasoline (roughly a quarter of total US emissions) by planting trees, we'd need to grow 4.3 billion pounds of wood every day - more than 1.5 trillion pounds/year. When you fill your tank, count 2x4s as the gallons roll by, and mentally scale this up to every driver in the country. If one understands both scale and the basics of climate change, this is both astonishing and terrifying. We have faced terrifying situations before and we have emerged from them. Indeed, throughout human history, we have always lived in times characterized by the wonderful and horrible simultaneously. We have also always made apocalyptic prophecies that, at least at the global scale, have not come to pass. For the credible ones, people eventually acted and were able to meet the challenges (though sometimes at horrific costs). Recognizing that we have always been wrong in predicting global apocalypses and that when the situation becomes dire (as it is doing now) we have taken effective action is reason for hope. The process described here, through the story of a gallon of gasoline, couples clear science with powerful emotion. It closes with hope. And, it offers tools and a broader approach that can be widely replicated.","2019-12-01","2020-10-31 01:06:49","2020-10-31 01:06:49","2020-10-31 01:06:49","","","","13","","AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","","","","","","0815 Informal education; 4334 Disaster risk communication; 6309 Decision making under uncertainty; 6620 Science policy; EDUCATION; NATURAL HAZARDS; POLICY SCIENCES & PUBLIC ISSUES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We test the effects of variations in text and imagery on discrete emotions (i.e., hope, fear, and anger) and, indirectly, on support for climate mitigation policies. Political ideology is examined as a moderator. The findings indicate that news images and texts that focus on climate-oriented actions can increase hope and, in the case of texts, decrease fear and anger, and these effects generally hold across the ideological spectrum. In turn, the influence of emotions on policy support depends on ideology: Hope and fear increase support for climate policies for all ideological groups but particularly conservatives, whereas anger polarizes the opinions of liberals and conservatives. Implications for climate change communication that appeals to emotions are discussed.","2018","2020-10-31 01:09:23","2020-10-31 01:09:23","2020-10-31 01:09:23","585-602","","3","38","","","Is There Any Hope?","","","","","","","en","© 2017 Society for Risk Analysis","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/risa.12868","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\YXLGK79C\Feldman_Hart_2018_Is There Any Hope.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\NJG573NB\risa.html","","","Climate change communication; emotions; imagery; policy support; political ideology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives-either economic or social norms, or both-can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.","2016","2020-10-31 01:48:00","2020-10-31 01:48:00","","14507-14514","","51","113","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27911770 PMCID: PMC5187698","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\E5I9GPYP\Lubchenco et al_2016_The right incentives enable ocean sustainability successes and provide hope for.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27911770","","Animals; Humans; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Conservation of Natural Resources; Motivation; Climate Change; complex adaptive systems; conservation solutions; Ecology; fisheries; Fisheries; Fishes; marine reserves; Oceans and Seas; Public Policy; rights-based fishery management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are set to play a key role in personalised medicine. However, despite the growing application and importance of PRS, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results.

Approximately 50% of genotypes at single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exclusively on the HumanHap 550 can be accurately imputed from direct genotypes on the SNP Array 5.0 or Illumina HumanHap 300. This roughly halves differences in coverage and power between the platforms. When the relative cost of currently available genome-wide SNP platforms is accounted for, and finances are limited but sample size is not, the highest-powered strategy in European populations is to genotype a larger number of individuals with the HumanHap 300 platform and carry out imputation. Platforms consisting of around 1 million SNPs offer poor cost efficiency for SNP association in European populations.","2008-07","2020-12-01 22:36:06","2020-12-01 22:36:06","","112-119","","1","83","","Am J Hum Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 18589396 PMCID: PMC2443836","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\C2JNTFS8\Anderson et al_2008_Evaluating the effects of imputation on the power, coverage, and cost.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18589396","","Humans; Cohort Studies; Algorithms; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Computer Simulation; Alleles; Cost Control; Discriminant Analysis; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Genome; Haplotypes; Medical Laboratory Science; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Recombination, Genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, imputation has only rarely been performed based on family relationships to infer genotypes of un-genotyped individuals. Using 8998 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants genotyped with Affymetrix 550K SNPs, we imputed genotypes of same set of SNPs for additional 3121 participants, most of whom were never genotyped due to lack of DNA sample. Prior to imputation, 122 pedigrees were too large to be handled by the imputation software Merlin. Therefore, we developed a novel pedigree splitting algorithm that can maximize the number of genotyped relatives for imputing each un-genotyped individual, while keeping new sub-pedigrees under a pre-specified size. In GWAS of four phenotypes available in FHS (Alzheimer disease, circulating levels of fibrinogen, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and uric acid), we compared results using genotyped individuals only with results using both genotyped and imputed individuals. We studied the impact of applying different imputation quality filtering thresholds on the association results and did not found a universal threshold that always resulted in a more significant p-value for previously identified loci. However most of these loci had a lower pvalue when we only included imputed genotypes with with $60% SNP- and $50% person-specific imputation certainty. In summary, we developed a novel algorithm for splitting large pedigrees for imputation and found a plausible imputation quality filtering threshold based on FHS. Further examination may be required to generalize this threshold to other studies.","2012-12-17","2020-12-01 23:04:42","2020-12-01 23:04:42","2020-12-01 23:04:42","e51589","","12","7","","PLoS ONE","Using Family-Based Imputation in Genome-Wide Association Studies with Large Complex Pedigrees","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\TEXCECYP\Chen et al. - 2012 - Using Family-Based Imputation in Genome-Wide Assoc.pdf","","","","Xiong, Momiao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated their impacts on the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country and response performance measures.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We did a descriptive epidemiological study of all laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New Zealand from Feb 2 to May 13, 2020, after which time community transmission ceased. We extracted data from the national notifiable diseases database and the national SARS-CoV-2 test results repository. Demographic features and disease outcomes, transmission patterns (source of infection, outbreaks, household transmission), time-to-event intervals, and testing coverage were described over five phases of the response, capturing different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Risk factors for severe outcomes (hospitalisation or death) were examined with multivariable logistic regression and time-to-event intervals were analysed by fitting parametric distributions using maximum likelihood estimation.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>1503 cases were detected over the study period, including 95 (6·3%) hospital admissions and 22 (1·5%) COVID-19 deaths. The estimated case infection rate per million people per day peaked at 8·5 (95% CI 7·6–9·4) during the 10-day period of rapid response escalation, declining to 3·2 (2·8–3·7) in the start of lockdown and progressively thereafter. 1034 (69%) cases were imported or import related, tending to be younger adults, of European ethnicity, and of higher socioeconomic status. 702 (47%) cases were linked to 34 outbreaks. Severe outcomes were associated with locally acquired infection (crude odds ratio [OR] 2·32 [95% CI 1·40–3·82] compared with imported), older age (adjusted OR ranging from 2·72 [1·40–5·30] for 50–64 year olds to 8·25 [2·59–26·31] for people aged ≥80 years compared with 20–34 year olds), aged residential care residency (adjusted OR 3·86 [1·59–9·35]), and Pacific peoples (adjusted OR 2·76 [1·14–6·68]) and Asian (2·15 [1·10–4·20]) ethnicities relative to European or other. Times from illness onset to notification and isolation progressively decreased and testing increased over the study period, with few disparities and increasing coverage of females, Māori, Pacific peoples, and lower socioeconomic groups.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>New Zealand's response resulted in low relative burden of disease, low levels of population disease disparities, and the initial achievement of COVID-19 elimination.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment Strategic Scientific Investment Fund, and Ministry of Health, New Zealand.</p>","2020-11-01","2020-12-07 22:14:42","2020-12-07 22:14:42","2020-12-07 22:14:42","e612-e623","","11","5","","The Lancet Public Health","COVID-19 in New Zealand and the impact of the national response","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.thelancet.com","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 33065023","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\6QEIRE6F\Jefferies et al_2020_COVID-19 in New Zealand and the impact of the national response.pdf; ; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\LFYBJFRU\fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The panel suggested various principles for the development of telemedicine and telecare, concerning: patients, users and carers, approach to service delivery, research and knowledge, and conditions of use. Many of the principles echoed the founding values of the National Health Service, yet have arguably been absent from both policy pronouncements and the telemedicine literature, which largely views new health technologies themselves as ‘value free’, i.e. developed untouched by social and political relations.

It can be a difficult method to apply, however, because it requires knowledge of various techniques, and the software required to perform most of these techniques is not readily available in common statistical software packages. In this teacher’s corner, we address these barriers by providing an overview of general steps and operations in a computational text analysis project, and demonstrate how each step can be performed using the R statistical software.
