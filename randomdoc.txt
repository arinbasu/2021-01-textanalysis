The internal report, titled a Health Check looked into Let's Get Wellington Moving (LGWM) and its plans to develop a better transport system for the city.

The LGWM's aim is to ease the capital's congestion woes by building rapid transit from the city to the airport, improving public transport and cycleways and easing traffic choke points on arterial routes.

However, a review into its current state found it's at risk of failing to deliver an integrated, cohesive, prioritised and outcomes-driven package.

It described the programme as "being process-driven" with a "bottom up approach".

"Capability gaps and under-resourcing have exacerbated the problem. There is no single point of failure, but critical improvements must be made across several areas."

It said the team was never adequately resourced and key roles have remained vacant or are only filled on a temporary basis.

"Our principal finding from a people perspective is that the programme was not set up for success from the outset.

"The programme's current brand value in the market has meant that attracting and retaining talent is challenging."

The report said LGWM's brand is currently diminished due to perceived lack of delivery and future uncertainty.

The report also noted there was a proven lack of experience within the team which had no expertise in delivering a complex, large scale programme and a "strategic leadership vacuum".

The Health Check described the current culture as "detrimental to a collaborative and productive working environment" between the partners involved in LGWM.

It said people working on projects had an 'us' versus 'them' mentality and described the culture as combative where they were wary of putting their views forward.
