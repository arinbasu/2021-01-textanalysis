The DTM can also be created from a quanteda corpus object, which stores text and associated
meta-data, including document-level variables. When a corpus is tokenized or converted into a
DTM, these document-level variables are saved in the object, which can be very useful later when the
documents in the DTM need to be used as covariates in supervised machine learning. The stored
document variables also make it possible to aggregate quanteda objects by groups, which is
extremely useful when texts are stored in small units—like Tweets—but need to be aggregated in a
DTM by grouping variables such as users, dates, or combinations of these.
Because quanteda is compatible with the readtext package, creating a corpus from texts on disk
takes only a single additional step. In the following example we create a DTM from the readtext data
as imported above
