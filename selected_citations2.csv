As access to WGS has grown, greater amounts of molecular data have helped improve our ability to detect outbreaks, investigate transmission chains, and explore large-scale population dynamics, such as the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the wide adoption of WGS also poses challenges due to the amount of data generated and the need to transform raw data prior to analysis. This complexity means that public health agencies may need more advanced computational infrastructure, a broader technical workforce, and new approaches to data management and stewardship. As both a guide for how this development could occur, and a place to initiate discussion, we describe ten proposals for developing and supporting an informatics infrastructure for public health.","2020-01-11","2020-03-28 22:51:51","2020-04-17 09:44:33","2020-03-28 22:51:51","","","","","","","","","","","","other","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.20944/preprints202001.0107.v1","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\A428KA29\Black et al. - 2020 - Ten Recommendations for Supporting Open Pathogen G.pdf","","genomics; not covid specific; data analysis; recommendation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix—a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies—for this purpose.","2005-05","2020-07-27 19:41:57","2020-07-27 19:41:57","2020-07-27 19:41:57","561-566","","5","113","","Environ Health Perspect","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 15866764 PMCID: PMC1257548","","C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\3TAZGAH5\Barnett et al_2005_The Application of the Haddon Matrix to Public Health Readiness and Response.pdf; C:\Users\aba80\Zotero\storage\2F7ZSCSS\barnett_et_al_2005_the_application_of_the_haddon_matrix_to_public_health_readiness_and_response.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257548/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
